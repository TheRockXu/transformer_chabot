0,What is structural estimation compared to reduced form estimation?,"Structural estimation is a term coined by the Cowles commission which at the time seems to have been dominated by Haavelmo, Koopmans and a few others. The motto of the Cowles commission (after 1965) was: ""Theory and Measurement"". The phrase represents the underlying rationale of structural modelling, that measurement cannot be done without some kind of theory. To my knowledge, the phrase was first used by Koopmans in ""Identification Problems in Economic Model Construction"":"
1,Seminal papers that later were proven to contain errors,"My favorite example is the initial formulation of Arrow's impossibility theorem in the first edition of Arrows' ""Social Choice and Individual Values"" (1951). In the first edition, Arrow claimed that, together with 4 other conditions, the following domain condition"
2,Why is the oil future price negative?,"I'm answering from my memory of Reddit comments like blitzkrieg9
 and AdmiralAkbar1. Don't hesitate to edit this post to link to them, but I can't remember where exactly I saw them. And I haven't just copied and pasted – I've rewritten out typos. "
3,Criticism of Math in Economics,"I find that the essay ""The New Astrology"" by Alan Jay Levinovitz (an assistant professor of philosophy and religion, not an economist) makes some good points."
4,How will non-rich citizens make a living if jobs keep getting replaced by robots and are outsourced?,This is an interesting question a lot of good labour economists have been thinking about for a while. There are a few conflicting theories as to what will happen. You could base a whole career on this question.
5,Fundamental equations in economics,"Instead of proposing specific equations, I will point to two concepts that lead to specific equations for specific theoretical set ups:"
6,Why do Australian milk farmers need to protest supermarkets' milk price?,"I would like to contradict Kenny LJ explicitly on his claim that ""the free market works""."
7,What are some results in Economics that are both a consensus and far from common sense?,The principle of comparative advantage
8,Why do we need to “get the economy moving again”?,"Previously, Kate preferred spending \$50 on food at Alice's restaurant (rather than cook her own food). And Alice preferred spending \$50 getting her hair cut at Kate's (rather than cut her own hair). That Kate must now cook her own food and Alice cut her own hair means that value has fallen (where value is broadly defined as the degree to which individuals' desires are satisfied)."
9,Why do economists disagree so much?,"Some areas of economics have more consensus and predictive power than others. Most economists would agree on the effects of trade barriers, could fairly accurately forecast the effects of a price change given a good demand estimate, would come to the same conclusion about the effects of allowing a merger between two large competing firms, know how asset prices will react to a change in interest rates, etc."
10,Are there any non-paywalled reputable economics journals?,"Theoretical Economics (TE) and Quantitative Economics are two open access, peer reviewed journals. The former I know is of very good quality, arguably the top ""field journal"" in microeconomic theory. "
11,Why do celebrities get high wages?,"If you ask yourself how much a potential employer would have to pay you to convince you to work for him, the answer is probably something like ""at least as much as I could earn by doing the same job for another employer"". So, provided there are several employers competing to hire workers, you can think of employers as bidding against each other for the best employees. But how much will firms bid? Each employer would be willing to pay up to the difference between its profit if it hired this particular worker and its profit if it took the next best alternative. "
12,What benefits do governments receive from not eliminating debt?,"Most of the same considerations apply to countries as apply to businesses and people, plus a couple of extra cons"
13,What has caused the recent 25% unemployment rate in Spain?,Here's an explanation from Paul Krugman. You can read more about this in Krugman's book End This Depression Now!. 
14,How to intuitively understand the 'Intuitive criterion'?,"A concise, completely informal way of putting it is this: The intuitive criterion rules-out any out-of-equilibrium beliefs that can only be correct if some player did something stupid."
15,Is a universal basic income possible in the United States?,"This is a good question. To be concrete, I think it's easier to pick a single number - this is arbitrary, but I'll go with the figure of $10,000 offered in the proposal by Charles Murray (one of the most prominent conservative supporters of a universal basic income). I'll assume that this is offered to every adult in the US age 18 and over, expanding slightly on Murray's 21 and over proposal."
16,People pathologically hoard so much cash that they impoverish the entire nation,"But when people pathologically hoard so much cash that they impoverish
  the entire nation"
17,"A law against selling any house cheaper than it was bought for, what consequences would that have?","That would be really, really bad."
18,What is the economic purpose of increasing the minimum wage?,What makes you think that economists are so aligned against the minimum wage? Take a look at the IGM Forum that polls top academic economists. There is substantial disagreement about the effects and welfare implications of a minimum wage hike.
19,How can power/electricity prices be negative?,"Yes, customers who were exposed to day-ahead wholesale market prices were paid to use electricity."
20,How do Gini coefficients correlate with the cost of higher education?,"I think this gives an answer reasonably close to what you're looking for (from the NYTimes article, ""In climbing the income ladder, location matters,"" featuring research by Raj Chetty, Emmanuel Saez, and others)."
21,Why is bartering uncommon in modern countries?,The main likely reasons why barter is not more common are:
22,What are examples for the phenomenon that more (or better) information makes everybody worse off?,Traffic reports are another type of information that potentially makes everyone worse off.
23,Who exactly foots the bill if Greece defaults,"Who would pay depends on the terms of the default. Sometimes holders of similar debts are not treated equally, and this can play out in different ways. Greeks could default on external debts but continue to pay internal creditors. Or because the ESM and other entities are providing ongoing financing, perhaps they will continue to be repaid when others are not to keep those spigots open. Or, less extremely, they could vary the degree of forbearance, term changes, and extent of default. "
24,Why is fuel more expensive on the high way in Europe?,"Because there is no indication in your question that you are a student or practitioner of economics, I am writing an answer for a lay audience. Let me know if you would like more technical detail."
25,Why do people buy negative interest rate bonds?,"Some pictures and text are from Schroders and other websites, but I don't remember all them. "
26,"From an economics perspective, what are the ramifications of a currency with fixed money supply?","FooBar is quite right that unless you expect GDP growth to stop, fixed nominal supply currencies will lead to deflation."
27,Why is collective bargaining by a group of employees not the same thing as price-fixing?,This is more of an elaboration of The Almighty Bob's answer:
28,What are Giffen Goods?,"Consider the Slutsky equation,
$$
\frac{\partial x}{\partial p} = \frac{\partial x^c}{\partial p} -
\frac{\partial x}{\partial I} x.
$$"
29,How can I obtain Leontief and Cobb-Douglas production function from CES function?,"The proofs I will present are based on techniques relevant to the fact that the CES production function has the form of a generalized weighted mean.
This was used in the original paper where the CES function was introduced, Arrow, K. J., Chenery, H. B., Minhas, B. S., & Solow, R. M. (1961). Capital-labor substitution and economic efficiency. The Review of Economics and Statistics, 225-250.
The authors there referred their readers to the book Hardy, G. H., Littlewood, J. E., & Pólya, G. (1952). Inequalities , chapter $2 $."
30,Partial vs. general equilibrium,Let's put the succinct answer by @TheAlmightyBob into an abstract model:
31,Can inflation occur in a positive-sum game currency system such as the Stack Exchange reputation system?,"In the Stack Exchange reputation ""economy"", we can think of the reputation points as ""money"". And the ""goods"" are:"
32,How do Marxist economists solve the Diamond-Water Paradox?,"The Labor Theory of Value has been replaced by the theory of Marginal Utility, which was already accepted by Marx time. In fact he acknowledged:"
33,Has the Nash Equilibrium lead to any significant economic discoveries?,Two areas that have been profoundly affected by game theoretic research stemming from Nash's contribution are
34,What is the likely result of rent control in Berlin?,"Rent control will over time decrease the supply of housing while increasing demand causing a housing shortage. Moreover, there are also studies that show that under rent control there are not just shortages of houses but also misallocation, that is the houses are no longer allocated to people who have highest utility/consumer surplus from having them (Glaeser and Luttmer, 2003)."
35,In what sense are “new-Keynesian” models “new” and in what sense are they “Keynesian”?,"In essence New-Keynesians adapt micro to macro theory. This is in contrast to new classicals which adapt macro theory to orthodox neoclassical market-clearing microfoundations. New-Keynesians adapt the rational expectations hypothesis but accept that market may fails due to wage and price stickiness and Friedman's natural rate hypothesis. The New-Keynesians, the RBC school and New Classicals focus on issues relating to aggregate supply and have been the dominating schools since the 1970's, especially the new-Keynesians have dominated the last one to two decades. On the other hand ""old""-Keynesians and the orthodox monetarists mainly focused on issues relating to aggregate demand and these dominated economic thinking pre-1970's. "
36,Should we expect more structural technological unemployment if growth becomes more limited by natural resources and less by labour?,I understand that you are asking the following
37,Why aren't house prices included in CPI?,"The CPI stands for a Consumer Price Index. As in the price of things that are consumed (at a particular moment in time). Real estate prices are not the price of something consumed because they contain the value of current housing consumption but also the capitalized value of future housing consumption. As such, including house prices would make the CPI a mixture of consumption at different times, and therefore unsuitable for comparing the price of consumption bundles at distinct times. Instead, they use a purer measure of the price of housing consumption: rents. "
38,What are FOCs and SOCs?,"Suppose you have a differentiable function $f(x)$, which you want to optimize by choosing $x$. If $f(x)$ is utility or profit, then you want to choose $x$ (i.e. consumption bundle or quantity produced) to make the value of $f$ as large as possible. If $f(x)$ is a cost function, then you want to choose $x$ to make $f$ as small as possible. FOC and SOC are conditions that determine whether a solution maximizes or minimizes a given function. "
39,How does Black Friday work?,"Though the Black Friday savings do exist, they are less significant than in some of the early years when the ""Black Friday"" sales were just starting to get really popular.  Raising prices is one way that merchants could try to respond, but then they might exclude the deal-seekers whom they are targeting."
40,Where to start learning economics as a mathematician?,"McCloskey's Applied Theory of Price is somewhat legendary as a model of clarity. It is, sadly, no longer in print. However, a PDF is available here: http://www.deirdremccloskey.com/docs/price.pdf. The level of mathematical sophistication in this book (like in most good economics!) is not that high, but the book gives a deeper look at the important concepts than is to be found in most extant introductory undergraduate texts."
41,"If I don't pay a debt, then the creditor takes my goods. Why, then, do Greek creditors not take Greece?","In general, there are three kinds of debt:"
42,What do supply-demand curves really look like?,"You sometimes find textbooks drawing the supply and demand curves as concave upwards, as such:"
43,Is the Occupy Wall Street famous 1% stable?,"I've not see a strict analysis of the top one percent but I have seen an analysis of the top 400 tax payers, the very highest income taxpayers:"
44,Why do different countries have different currency?,"I will focus on some economics reasons not mentioned explicitly so far. There are economic benefits to having your own currency. Your question essentially raises the question of so-called ""Optimum Currency Areas"" (OCAs). There was a lot of interest in the question of what areas should have the same currency. It is in general not immediately obvious that different countries should have the same currency, or even that the same country should have the same currency everywhere."
45,Is net neutrality not important in a competitive market of internet providers?,"Yes, if there were more competition then net neutrality would not be such a big issue. Any throttling would cause an ISP to lose customers to competitors."
46,"I lost $100 in the laundry, who won?","The central bank that issues the currency won; they can now issue an additional $100 without increasing the price level. This is similar to seignorage rents due to overseas circulation— in fact, to a central bank, the two are indistinguishable, as the central bank would be unaware that your note had been destroyed."
47,Why are real median household incomes stagnant?,"I find your question very interesting. The metric of median household income is also used by others to argue the presence of income inequality:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_United_States#Causes"
48,Why is capital income taxed differently than wage income?,"One reason is the inflationary gain problem.  Let me give an example with simple numbers.  I make \$100 in income and pay 20% tax of \$20.  I have \$80 left, which I invest in a stock.  The stock goes up in value at the same rate as inflation, about 3.5% a year.  After 20 years, it's worth about \$160, but \$160 has the same value now as \$80 did when I earned it.  So in effect, I have made no gain.  If I have to pay a 20% tax on the \$80 nominal gain, then I actually have \$8 less spending power than when I made the investment.  Just in order to keep pace, I would have needed returns of 125% inflation.  "
49,How will non-rich citizens make a living if jobs keep getting replaced by robots and are outsourced?,This is an interesting question a lot of good labour economists have been thinking about for a while.

69,Is zero inflation desirable?,"The optimal level of inflation is very debated with unclear answers. There are many reasons, and a great answer would be very long. It should also distinguish between expected inflation and surprises."

In general only 17% of consumers are compatible with rationality ergo the remaining part cannot be expected utility maximizers.  Quah has a nice paper on the revealed preference theory of expected utility (among other models), he uses Choi dataset to test expected utility hypothesis that is going to be rejected more times than rationality https://ideas.repec.org/p/lec/leecon/13-24.html"
96,"Car prices haven't changed in 20 years, no inflation?","Inflation is measured against a basket of goods. It's a symptom of what's going on in markets. Some products go up in price over time. Some go down in time. Some stay the same price, but change their specification."
97,What does Yanis Varoufakis mean by “surplus recycling mechanism”?,"""Surplus recycling"" is a term coined (to my knowledge) by Varoufakis to describe the fact that a country that enjoys a trade surplus should reinvest the surplus in the domestic economies of its trading partners. Such a policy was conduced with success by the United States in the years following WW2, where the Marshall plan and similar policies in Asia took place, mainly for political reasons."
98,"When a country adopts the Euro, what happens to its debt?","Yes, upon the introduction of the euro on January 1, 1999, all debt (indeed, all nominal contracts) in participating countries was converted from national currency to euros at a legally defined conversion rate. See this press release from December 31, 1998, which states:"
99,Topological concepts in economic theory,"I strongly suspect that an emerging important area for applications of measure theory will be in approximate dynamic programming techniques. Approximate dynamic programming (aka ""reinforcement learning"" in the computer science literature) has been the direction of research work in the last ~10-20 years of the dynamic programming literature. Economics is only just now starting to adopt some of these advances. For example of the direction of the DP literature, see Bertsekas' most recent 4th edition expansion of his dynamic programming series, or Powell's Approximate DP: Solving the Curse of Dimensionality. Economists are just starting to pick up some of these tools, both directly and indirectly, and I suspect that they will have a growing impact on the literature over the next few years. Some of the analytical background for convergence of these methods is topology and dynamical systems."
100,When Optimal Control fails (?),"I believe the problem is that the steady state may not exist, and the system instead exhibits steady growth (depending on parameters)."
101,Unemployment and the Minimum Wage---what are the main counter-arguments to Card and Krueger?,"Isaac Sorkin, a grad student at Michigan, has addressed this. Here is Miles Kimball blogging it, link. Main argument there is that previous work measures short run elasticities, which are less responsive than in the long run. You can surely find more by checking Sorkin's citations. "
102,What is the importance of Epstein-Zin preferences?,I think CompEcon covered most of the points that I was going to mention.  Just a few last thoughts:
103,Has an increase in housing supply in popular cities including Amsterdam led to an increase in house prices?,"Let's just say that economists don't really agree with this thesis, and most city-level empirical evidence points in the opposite direction. E.g."
104,Does merger control really affect market structure?,"Clifford Winston´s excellent book Government Failure versus Market Failure: 
Microeconomics Policy Research and Government Performance surveys the literature on the effects of government regulation generally and antitrust merger control specifically. He doesn't exactly answer your question on economy-wide structural effects, but largely concludes that merger control is rather ineffective. A small quote:"
105,Why is fractional reserve banking allowed?,"I recommend a careful read of the Wikipedia page for Fractional-reserve banking because it seems you are confused about how fractional reserve banking works.
Banks only lend out money they have under fractional reserve banking and, in fact, strictly less than they have. Those funds are a mix of deposits, funds from other debt issuance, and bank equity. They don't lend out funds they don't have and they don't simply credit accounts at will in the way you suggest. When they credit a borrower's account with funds, they have to debit those funds from elsewhere on their balance sheet. So, lend-able funds go down as borrower's funds go up, and then the resulting loan is a new asset of the firm. While they do create money this way, they do so at the expense of these lone-able funds so the loaning out doesn't create new assets for the bank."
106,Why is the Free Rider Problem a problem?,"According to the standard criterion used to evaluate welfare (Pareto efficiency), the problem with 'free riding' is that goods are not produced even though they cost less to produce than they are worth to consumers. That means that we are forfeiting an opportunity to help people without harming anyone else."
107,Real Exchange Rate vs PPP rate,"Both answers here are giving really good definitions of the concepts, but I think it's important to additionally talk about the relation between the two to clarify the justified confusion and to compare them."
108,Implications of abolishing Fractional Reserve Banking on mortgages and interest rates,"There is a long standing problem in most discussions of Fractional Reserve Banking (FRB), around the precise definition of money. Cash money (that is M0) is an asset on the banking system balance sheet, while deposit money (the liability) is the money that is created by lending. "
109,Why can't a country print its own money to spend it only abroad?,"In order for one country to spend in another, it needs to exchange its currency for the currency of the other nation. This is done through something called the foreign exchange market. Like most markets however, the laws of supply and demand apply here too. If a country suddenly starts printing a lot of money, the actual value of its money in the foreign exchange market will go down (due to its increased supply). This will ultimately mean the currency will depreciate with respect to others, and will thus have lower buying power."
110,How could the economic cost of the world not speaking the same language be estimated?,"To measure the costs of different people speaking different languages, researchers use a ""linguistic distance"" metric, see for example this paper. However, measuring the cost of linguistic diversity appears to be challenging. Some effects are shown along the following lines."
111,Are monotonic and continuous preferences necessarily rational?,"Consider a preference relation in $\mathbb{R}^2$ such that $x=(x_1,x_2)\succsim (y_1,y_2)=y$ $\iff$ $x_1\geq y_1$ and $x_2\geq y_2$. "
112,Are there theories that invalidate the “tragedy of the commons”?,"As you implied, the tragedy of the commons was the standard theory in Economics. This is no longer the case. However--and this is an important point--rejection of this one-size-fits-all approach to public resource management did not come from the emergence of new theories; rather, it resulted from actually studying real-world outcomes. In fact, it's for her work doing exactly this that Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize in Economics. As described by the Nobel committee:"

115,"If I gain, then someone else loses. Correct?","I completely agree with denesp's answer, however I think you can make it even simpler."
116,How is price elasticity determined in practice?,"In many practical instances, price elasticity of demand (PED) is calculated in a back of the envelope fashion, just as taught in the textbooks! Firms can adjust their price by some small amount and observe the demand response. For relatively small changes in price and quantity, little accuracy is lost by assuming that the demand function is locally linear, so that the change in price and demand jointly give an estimate for $$\frac{dQ}{dp}.$$ Since $p$ and $Q$ are already known, this is enough to calculate the PED:
$$\eta=\frac{dQ}{dp}\frac{p}{Q}.$$"

120,Use of mathematics and imprecise definition of terms,"Edesess is attacking what is really just a straw man of economics. I'm not sure he really understands the field. To start, economics is not math. We're not claiming that it is. It's more of an ""applied"" science. Economists have never claimed that these definitions are precise in the way that mathematics is. These definitions are modeling constructs---they're for applied work. They're use is temporary in a way. The point is to try to convey an idea in a more precise way than just in words---but everyone knows that they're not a precise as we would like and not as precise as they ultimately should be. They're meant to be debated and later refined. But, as all applied scientists know, you've got to start somewhere and sometimes ideas are best conveyed through simpler---if less detailed mean.  "

123,The relationship between the expenditure function and many others!,"Following up on the excellent MWG diagram in Amstell's answer, the fundamental observation needed is that holding $p$ fixed, $e$ and $v$ are inverses of each other. $e$ tells us the amount we need to spend to get a certain amount of utility $u$, while $v$ tells us the maximum amount of utility we can get from a certain expenditure $w$. Whenever we want to convert from utility to wealth, we use $e$; and whenever we want to convert from wealth to utility, we use $v$."
124,"What was economics like as a field before Adam Smith, the father of *modern* economics?","Direct predecessors to Adam Smith within the classical tradition (maybe a more useful distinction than modern) include Hume, Locke and Dudley North. Before the classical economists, there were the physiocrats (18th century), such as Francois Quesnay and Turgot. The physiocrats emphasised agricultural productivity as a driver of the wealth of nations. They were contemporaneous with, but also preceded by mercantilists (16th century - 18th century). Mercantilists mostly concentrated on creating a favorable balance of trade, which would allow reserves to accumulate in the possession of an absolute ruler. They emphasized government control of the economy as an extension of state power. The mercantilists had a lot of influence in the policies of nations, for instance in the form of Colbert. Famous writers might include de Malynes and Mun. Mercantilists were one of the main targets of Adam Smith's critique. The distinction being that mercantilists believed the quantity of reserves to be the ultimate source of a nation's wealth and so emphasized protectionism, while Smith focused more on trade allowing inputs to become more productive. In doing so he was very influenced by Quesnay to whom he had considered dedicating The Theory of Moral Sentiments. The inclusion of gains from trade, self-interest and competition leading to increased productivity, and division of labor distinguishes Smith from these earlier writings and forms the link to ""modern"" economics."
125,How do reserves move between the 12 federal reserve banks?,This is surprisingly subtle. 
126,Have there been instances where economists have advocated a trade embargo?,"Free trade is, on the whole, one of the few otherwise controversial policy topics on which economists have near-perfect consensus. Historically, this consensus has long been strong in the English tradition (Hume, Smith, Ricardo, Mill), albeit less strong elsewhere. Famously, 1028 American economists signed an unsuccessful petition in 1930 begging Herbert Hoover not to approve the Smoot-Hawley tariff. If the IGM Economic Experts panel is any guide, consensus remains firm today."

128,Are there Utility Monsters in Economics?,"There is a type of protection called a liability rule, where I, $A$, can take something from $B$, if I pay the damages $c$ which are court-ordered preemptively. Copyright law is all about liability rules. If the damages are correlated with $B$'s valuation appropriately, then efficiency holds. You are interested in the opposite case. If IP law doesn't get it right, this would be an example matching your hypothetical as I understand it. And some might say this is justified. A company might want to keep some research under wraps to prevent competitors from also using it and making it even more valuable to society through investment. So the expiration of a patent might fit this scenario in a roundabout way too if we start the model where the company already owns the patent and a court is deciding when to let it expire."

132,Available code for computing solutions to matching algorithms?,"While answering a comment, I realized I had a post-worth response. R has become the ""default language"" for a lot of computational research statistics (for a number of reasons; nice NYT article here). It's high level, free and open-source, and has a closely-related journal for publishing statistical algorithms. Citations and peer review are key for academia, so you get a lot of well-described code posted to the R archives (CRAN) with descriptions posted to JStat. This spills over into a lot of blogs and quick demonstration code posts."

138,What happens if the “control variables” are also endogenous?,"I don't want to emphasize this too much, but it's worth mentioning that this is not true in general. The following derivation will hopefully provide some understanding of the ""contamination"" you mention. As a simple counterexample, suppose that the data generating process is given by
$$
Y = X_1 \beta_1 + X_2 \beta_2 + Z \gamma + \varepsilon,
$$
where $Z$ is unobserved. Let $Cov(X_1,Z) = 0$, $Cov(X_2, Z) \neq 0$, and 
$Cov(X_1,X_2) = 0$. Then, it
is clear that $X_2$ is ""endogenous."" But notice that because $Cov(X_1,Z) = 0$, our
estimate of $\beta_1$ will still be ok:
$$
\text{plim}\, \hat \beta_{1} = \beta_1 + \gamma \frac{Cov(X_1^*, Z)}{Var(X_1^*)} = \beta_1,
$$
where $X_1^* = M_2 X_1$ and $M_2 = [I - X_2(X_2'X_2)^{-1}X_2']$. Because $Cov(X_1,X_2) = 0$, $X_1^* = X_1$. So $Cov(X_1^*,Z)=0$. "

As to the Japanese situation it is quiet different from the US position from example. In fact most of the Japanese debt is owned by Japanese people (90% of the current debt). More specifically the BoJ plays a big role as a buyer, and puts pressure on Japanese yield, which makes it cheaper for the government to issue bonds ! "

151,Why does China buy so much U.S. Treasury debt?,"As was said above, buying debt to affect the exchange rate and make Chinese exports more attractive may be one reason to buy these Treasuries. Surely all of these are not reinvested into buying more debt and some of it is put into other civic projects."
152,First Order Condition for Profit Maximization in Gambling Industry,"The expression in question is in footnote $11$ of the referenced article. Reading the paper, we see that the decision variable here is ""the payout rate"", which is the reciprocal of $P$. So equivalently, we can solve the maximization problem with respect to $P$ (and not w.r.t. $Q$). More over, ""price elasticity of demand"" involves the derivative of $Q$ with respect to $P$, and not the other way around: "

154,What have been the main developments in macroeconomics and financial economics since the 2008 financial crisis?,"Well, in macroeconomics, namely in DSGE modelling, VOXEU has recently published a report on its uses by Central Banks (CBs), and future lines of improvement, which academics have been tackling but still hasn't found its way into CBs policy analysis. There's no space to explain all the new topics, nor do I think it's the intention of this question. So, I'll just enunciate the topics, with some references. More can be found in reading the report. Also, I'll focus on the theoretical considerations, i.e., it's known that, empirically, the the VAR obtained by solving the DSGE model can be considered as misspecified (see here). This is a WP, but you can easily find many articles on this subject, increasingly so since the crisis)"
155,Why does any treasury / central bank hold gold?,"I guess it is for the same reason that other countries hold foreign reserves.
The argument is that for some reason foreign markets become suddenly very adverse to take your currency, you should have some other medium of exchange that allow you to finance imports or serve short term external debt.
This is very related to the Guidotti–Greenspan rule."
156,Nash equilibrium - mistake in proof of paper?,"The objective is to show that, as long as $f'(n\hat\theta)\ne \alpha$, a firm can always engineer a package $(p',\hat\theta')=(p+\Delta p,\hat\theta+\Delta \hat{\theta})$ such that (i) a caring consumer strictly prefers this package, and (ii) the firm makes positive profits. "
157,Differentiate a positive externality and the absence of a negative externality. Tax or subsidize?,"A negative externality arises when the private net marginal benefit (i.e. the marginal benefit minus the marginal cost) of an activity exceeds the net social benefit. In such cases, the self-interested private decision maker will increase their participation in the activity even though it is socially inefficient for them to do so."
158,Why must the rate of GDP growth be positive?,"You would expect the rate of growth to be generally positive because inventing things or inventing more efficient ways of doing things, is generally a one way process - things don't get un-invented. So we would expect things that are made by machines to be made ever more quickly as the machines evolve and improve. Periods of negative growth are likely to correspond to some financial cock-up (e.g. asset bubbles) or increasing scarcity of some natural resources for which a replacement can not be found."

164,Why do lenders dislike early loan repayments?,"The reason that lenders dislike early repayments (known as ""prepayments"" or ""voluntary prepayments"") is that most lenders match their assets— the loans they've made to others— with liabilities of their own. This can lead to lenders facing significant interest rate risk. This is important to understand— while default risk is certainly significant, interest rate risk can be very large as well, sometimes greater than default risk."
165,What are the empirical techniques to show causation?,Natural experiments are usually a setting for causal inference rather than a causal inference tool per se. You often need to employ something like difference-in-difference or instrumental variables anyway even when you have a natural experiment.
166,Does the US stock market tend to rise after natural disasters?,"This news article with some statements from financial workers makes a case that usually big storms don't impact the national economy that much, even despite the large localized damages. While insurance companies will suffer in the stock market because of all those payouts they'll have to give, oil prices as you mentioned will be impacted, but in this case, gas prices will rise because of the change in the supply curve, so they will actually benefit in the stock market. The various effects combined end up with the stock market not really going up or down. It's more or less a wash. "
167,What is the reasoning behind the sharp fall of oil prices starting in mid 2014?,My understanding of the recent drop in oil price is due to recent changes in US drilling. They are now the worlds largest oil producer. This article by the economist does a good job explaining.

176,Why in most macro models technology is labor-augmenting?,"The mathematical reason, is that this happens in order for the model to have a steady-state in terms of growth rates: variables like Consumption, Capital, Income, grow at the steady-state, but grow at the same rate, so their ratios remain constant (and it is in this sense that this situation represents a ""steady""-state). If they were to grow at different rates, their ratios would tend to either zero or infinity which is not very realistic, since it would imply that the economy tends towards one or the other ""corner"" situation.

181,Why use empirical macroeconomic models when they are not policy invariant (Lucas Critique)?,"The response to the Lucas Critique was the emergence of RBC and DSGE models. Using microeconomic foundations of macro models we can simulate how behavior changes when policy changes and only estimate ""deep"" structural paramateres that are not policy variant. Before microfoundations we were estimating models where the estimation included the actions of people. With microfounded models today we try to seperate the actions. This was not possible in older models as we actually did not consider how people act or react, whereas microfoundations tell you how people would react."

It is not exactly a prisoner's dilemma since the outcome obtained by mutual cooperation (if both groups wait) is not Pareto-improving: everyone dies in that case. The only equilibrium is that one of the groups destroys the other boat as soon as possible; and any action played initially by the other group is possible in equilibrium, since this team is indifferent between waiting and triggering other the bomb (they will die one second later anyway)."

188,What metrics would indicate a house bubble rather than genuine market values?,"The first metric to look at is house-price-to-rent ratios. Rental prices capture the value of the housing (and housing-linked) services provided by a property, including things like how safe a neighborhood is, how good the schools are, et cetera. In contrast, house prices are the capitalized value of the future stream of housing services PLUS the price of an asset (mostly land; structure value beyond the housing services it provides is negligible). As a result, a higher ratio of house prices to rents means that, controlling for the value of housing services provided, we observe people paying more for housing assets (i.e., land)."

197,Why isn't the cost of shoes affected by their size?,"Most of the price of creating a shoe is the cost of labour to make it and the cost to ship it to the store. The cost of the materials needed to make the shoe is negligible. So, they can ignore the difference in material costs without losing too much money."
198,What is the point of all the models in an economics degree?,"Models are more than just math. Model is a simplification of a reality that allows you to study the underlying mechanisms. Models do not need to be mathematical. Many people actually create models without even realizing it. For example, if someone says ""minimum wage will not lead to unemployment"" that person is actually having a model even if they never present any mathematics. Such person definitely does not take into consideration full reality - every choice of every single individual, movement of every atom and so on. "
199,How does a country devalue its currency?,"Typically, a devaluation is achieved by selling the domestic currency in the foreign exchange market and buying other currencies. Suppose China sells one trillion Renminbi and buys 157 billion US dollars. From the point of view of the market, it is as if the supply of Renminbi just increased. As in any competitive market, an increase in supply will cause the price (i.e. the exchange rate) to fall: one Yuan will be worth less than before."

However, there is empirical evidence for both superior goods (demand that increases faster than income) and inferior goods (goods that decrease in income), this does not actually hold for real preferences.

221,Help understanding Lagrangian multipliers?,"A constrained optimization function maximizes or minimizes an objective subject to one or more constraints. As I understand it, the Lagrangian multiplier approach transforms a constrained optimization problem (I) into an unconstrained optimization problem (II) where the optimal control values to problem II are also the optimal control values to problem I. Additionally, the the objective functions in problems I and II take the same optimal values. The trick is a clever way of putting the constraints into the objective function directly rather than using them separately. "

249,Why is the derivative used to represent marginal cost instead of the difference?,"The derivative is used in some contexts, but not all, when the cost function is differentiable. In those contexts, it tends to be assumed that supply is continuous, not discrete. This is a matter of convention and of analytic convenience. It has the advantage of being consistent, whether you're approaching the supply point from above or from below."

257,Can the Machina Paradox be solved by expanding the choice set?,"No, I would not say that this resolves the Machina paradox, because it is exactly the same as the Machina paradox: the paradox does indeed require from you to look at the three possible outcomes. The M-C/W/G book discuss only the $B$ and $C$ outcomes because it is there where the paradox focuses on whether a violation of the axiom of independence may happen.  "

(Incidentally, DID is intended to do the same, but won't do as good a job as a well chosen instrument, so there is some doubts whether applying both of them is better then resorting to only one). However it is up to you to decide whether eligibility is exogenous, as it well may be, that those who are expecting higher return to treatment made sure to be eligible."

266,Homogenous of degree one in utility function.,"The way you show that $v(p,m)$ is homogeneous of degree one in $m$ is correct, but the reason why this implies that, $e(p,u)$ is homogeneous of degree one in $u$, is not very precise in your argument. For example, duality tells us
$$v(p,e(p,u))=u,$$
where $u$ is just a target utility level, but should not be $u(x)$ as in your proof."
267,Under what conditions is a monopoly undesirable?,"Firstly, suppose we take a utilitarian welfare standard that is linear in money. That is to say, suppose that both utility and profits are linear in the amount of money that consumers and firms have (but not necessarily linear in anything else). In that case, the Pareto standard and the utilitarian social welfare criterion coincide exactly! You can see a nice video of Jeff Ely talking about the intuition for this result here (look at the video titled ""efficiency""). Intuitively, if both the utility and profits are linear in money then we can always maximise utilitarian welfare by implementing the Pareto optimum and then constructing side-payments to support it."

Its competitors would want to get hold of its tangible and intangible assets (like customer base, patents etc). How is this different from ""fighting to a buyout""? In this second scenario, the company has always available the option/threat of continuing competition (possibly harmful to the competitors), while in the ""wind-up"" scenario it does not -it has committed to leave the business. So ""fighting to a buyout"" gives the company better position in negotiations, and so chances to increase its selling price compared to the ""wind up"" scenario.  "

274,Does 'ethical investing' have any effect?,"In a world where capital markets are infinitely deep there shouldn't be any price response to capital and so we wouldn't expect any consequences on firm behavior. There is some good empirical evidence for slow moving capital so that's probably not true. Ethical investing is likely to drive up capital costs at least some. In which case your question boils down to two questions, ""can an non-ethical company become an ethical one"" and one that may seem quite different, ""what is the elasticity of demand for capital with respect to the price of capital?"" Tobacco and munitions companies can shift into other business but they can't get ethical investment funds without abandoning that business. Other businesses like fair-trade coffee and certified conflict-free diamonds, may allow ethical investing in the current business with higher costs. The former group really only have one choice, to shrink in response to expensive capital. The latter group have a second option, to shift into ethical investing business models that may be more expensive but less expensive than the increase in the cost of capital. "

In other words, current observed acceptance rate should be a consistent estimator of theoretical acceptance rate, and equal to my measure.  "

287,Why is 10% the necessary upper bound for a negative interest rate?,"You're right to ask; the sentence you bolded is unclear in its wording. The effect of randomly invalidating 1/10th of the currency outstanding in one year is that in expectation, cash would have an interest rate of -10%. So when Mankiw says the policy ""might enable central banks to set negative interest rates provided the rate was less than 10%"", he means ""provided the rate was less negative than a -10% rate"". This is equivalent to saying that a central bank could set negative rates just so long as the bank set the rate $r$ such that $ -10\% \leq r < 0\% $."

Hence $Y$ is indeed intended to be a constant value, the steady state level of output around which the log-linearization is performed. $Y_t$ is just the level of total output in period $t$, while $y_t=\log Y_t$ is the log value of total output, as you say."
290,Does the Federal Reserve buy and sell stocks?,"No, the Fed is not allowed to buy stocks, they are allowed to buy government securities in open market operations in order to achieve the target rate for the federal funds rate.

The reason behind the ambiguity is that capital is a stock and investment is a flow variable. You are looking at capital in two different instants. Investment happens during the time between the two instants and its index is either the starting or the ending instant.

294,"Does risk aversion cause diminishing marginal utility, or vice versa?","I think I've found an answer to my question, in this excerpt from Nobel laureate John C. Harsanyi's 1994 paper ""Normative validity and meaning of von neumann-morgenstern utilities"", presented at the Ninth International Congress of Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of Science.  Harsanyi starts by proving the same lemma that Alecos proved in his answer, namely that if $u$ is a vNM utility function of an individual, then $u(10) - u(5) < u(5) - u(0)$ if and only if they would prefer a guaranteed 5 dollars compared to a 50% of 10 dollars and a 50% chance of 0 dollars.  In the comments section I said that was insufficient to demonstrate that the vNM utility function represented intensity of preferences, because what if the individual's actual pleasure and pain was accurately described by some other utility function $v$, which is a monotonic transformation but not an affine transformation of $u$?  In that case couldn't $v$ fail to satisfy the expected value property, and couldn't $v(10) - v(5) = v(5) - v(0)$?"
295,How can nominal interest rates be negative?,"There was only one reason to ever think that nominal interest rates couldn't go negative, which is that the nominal return on both forms of base money (electronic reserves, and paper currency) had a floor of zero -- and investors wouldn't accept a below-zero nominal return when they could get a higher one by holding base money."

299,Why is capital often not included in New Keynesian models? Is there a reason other than modeling difficulty?,"Capital is included in all the big estimated New Keynesian models (Smets-Wouters, Christiano-Eichenbaum-Evans), etc. But you're absolutely right that the stylized core NK model does not have capital - which is hard to defend on empirical grounds, since capital investment is a very important part of business cycle fluctuations and the response to monetary policy. Ultimately, the reason does basically boil down to the ""modeling difficulties"" that you mention."

However, that is not all the only source of money.  Banks are allowed to create money too.  Which is why higher aggregates like M2 and M3 are greater than MB."
307,Why is bargaining more common in poor countries?,"In first world countries, the price of a bottle of water is set by a well-established market. There are millions of prospective buyers of a bottle of water and thousands of prospective suppliers, and while many suppliers are able to achieve brand differentiation, for the most part their water is fungible. Moreover, the supply and demand curves of water are reasonably stable, and water companies have the excess capital to hold inventory stockpiles that further reduce the volatility of prices. There is little information asymmetry. Customers can easily comparison shop, and price discrimination is very difficult. Suppliers are generally large corporations, which means that allowing bargaining would introduce massive headaches, such as agent-principal issues. There's also a feedback effect: once an economy and culture are built around fixed prices, it's more difficult to introduce bargaining. Water companies are in a low-margin business where their money comes from high volume. Spending resources bargaining would destroy those margins."

Let $v$ be the premium observed in the market for new hires (so if the employee goes to another employer he will earn $h(e) + v$). Let $c$ be churn costs (recruitment plus loss of efficiency etc) to the current employer, if the employee leaves and needs to be replaced. "

327,Bartik Instrument Intuition,"I think the ""first stage"" would be $L_{it}$ on $\tilde{L_{it}}$. In the Peri paper above, the Bartik instrument is actually just included directly as $\tilde{L_{it}}$ as a control variable because it is an exogenous regressor in that form. If you are running labor supply elasticity regressions (and thus want to see the effect of $L_{it}$ itself on labor supply), if you can argue that the Bartik instrument is in fact exogenous, you can use it as an instrument for $L_{it}$. But, putting it directly in, as you suggested, would amount to something very similar (i.e., the Reduced Form rather than the Structural Eq.). "

330,Weakly monotone preferences with singleton indifference curves: do any of them admit a utility representation?,"What you're asking for is equivalent to finding an injective function $f:\mathbb R^n\to\mathbb R$ that is monotone in the sense that if $x$ is coordinate-wise at most as big as $y$, then $f(x)\le f(y)$.
As a first step, notice that this is equivalent to finding such a function from $(0,1)^n\to\mathbb (0,1)$.
And this is easy by interleaving the digits of the coordinates of $x$, i.e., if $x=(x^1,x^2,\ldots,x^n)=(0.x^1_1x^1_2\ldots,0.x^2_1x^2_2\ldots,\ldots,0.x^n_1x^n_2\ldots)$, then let $f(x)=0.x^1_1x^2_1\ldots x^n_1x^1_2x^2_2\ldots x^n_2x^1_3x^2_3\ldots x^n_3\ldots$.
This is clearly injective and we prove monotonicity as follows.
If $f(x)>f(y)$, then they differ first at some $x_i^h>y_i^h$ for which $x_j^h=y_j^h$ for all $j<i$.
But then $x^h>y^h$, so $x$ cannot be coordinate-wise at most as big as $y$."
331,Financial Smart Contract on Ethereum: can an Ether Futures contract be priced in Ether?,"Futures and Options are all about exchanging something for something else. These kind of derivatives all involve exchanging different 'kinds' of goods so it doesn't make sense to have both sides denominated in the same currency: When you have X Ethereum which you are willing to give up for Y Ethereum later, what you have is a loan. Loans aren't going to do much in terms of managing volatility, which is essentially, how much is Ethereum worth in terms of other stuff. "

Since most financial risk (but perhaps not operational risk) is proportional to net exposures this is a more sensible measure of total derivative risk at the banks. Since net exposures at the 6 banks with the largest derivative exposures circa 2014 were on the order of \$300 billion while their total assets were more than \$10 trillion, we may not have seen a disaster because the actual risk is appropriate to the scale of their broader operations.

If your standard unit of currency is more than that minimum value, you need to subdivide your currency to be able to represent smaller values.  In the U.S., we subdivide our U.S. Dollar into 100 cents, meaning that the smallest value that you can spend is $0.01.

The two parties will then engage in bargaining with the result that the socially efficient level of the activity is undertaken.

376,Why would a cash-rich company borrow money?,"You are right that it seems strange why a cash-rich company is borrowing. In the case of Apple, the money that they are borrowing is being used to pay dividends to shareholders. The reason why they aren't using their \$200 billion is because doing so would cost them tens of billions of dollars in taxes. The current US tax code taxes corporations at 35% when they bring money they made overseas back to the US (this is called repatriation). So while, Apple has \$200 billion on the surface, \$180 billion of that is sitting overseas and can't be used to pay shareholders. It is cheaper for them to borrow money to pay dividends, than incur the huge tax costs associated with repatriation."

389,"Finding demand function given a utility min(x,y) function","No, you should not use Lagrange multipliers here, but sound thinking. Suppose $x\neq y$, say for concreteness $x<y$. Let $\epsilon=y-x$. Then $\min\{x,y\}=x=\min\{x,x\}=\min\{x,y-\epsilon\}.$
So the consumer could reduce her consumption of good 2, without being worse off. On the other hand for all $\delta>0$, we would have $\min\{x+\delta,y-\epsilon/2\}>x=\min\{x,y\}$, so the consumer could be better of by reducing the consumption of the second good and spending the freed money on the first good. In an optimum, a consumer cannot improve so optimality requires $x=y$. It is also clear that consumers improve along the $x=y$ 45° ray. So you can simply use $x=y$ as an optimality condition to be substituted into your budget constraint and bypass Lagrange multipliers."

If there is a continuous function $u:M\times H\to\mathbb{R}$ such that $x\preceq_e z$ if and only if $u(e,x)\leq u(e,z)$, one can derive the result directly from Berge's maximum theorem. If $H$ is locally compact, as it is the case if $H=\mathbb{R}^n$, then such a function can always be found, this follows from Theorem 1 in Mas-Colell's On the Continuous Representation of Preorders (at least if $M$ is metrizable, I'm not sure on that point).

411,How infinite Nash equilibria are possible in a game?,"Well the intuition is quite straightforward: as you have mentioned yourself, player 2 is indifferent between playing any action in pure strategies, or randomizing in any possible way. So, for a mixed strategy equilibrium to exist, player 2 needs to play L w/ probability 4/7. If this is the case, it is irrelevant what Player 1 player---player 2's outcome is the same. As a result, in pure strategies the Equilibria are L,L and R,R and, in Mixed strategies, q=4/7 and p can take any value between 0 and 1. Hence, there exist infinite possible Nash Equilibria (p just has to obey the fundamental laws of probability). "

423,Why does immigration boost the economy? (or does it not…?),"You’re right, the migration of workers boost the economy. It’s a stylized fact. It may have political consequences, though, but it is not the part of the analysis of economics. Let’s consider $A$ the set of active labour force of an economy before, and $A'$ after the migration. Then $A$ is the subset of $A'$:
$$A \subseteq A'$$
This notation means that the social planner of the economy is able to optimize on a greater number of workers. We can assume that opening the door for migrant workers is at least as good as it was before migration:
$$A \preceq A'$$
If this condition is not true (e.g. the migrants doesn't want to work), the authorities of the economy won't open borders for migrant workers."

For most Western countries, Denmark included, migrants are modest net positive contributors (""they pay in more than they take out"")."
427,Why doesn't anyone talk about GNW (Gross National Wealth)?,"Historically, the distinction between GDP and GNW goes back (at least) to Adam Smith. Before Smith, it was quite common to measure a country's economic power by its wealth. For example, this was very characteristic of the Mercantilistic school in the 17th century. Following the motto ""you are what you have"", mercantilists suggested that countries should try to accumulate as much wealth (for them: gold) as possible. This was to be achieved by a combination of an export oriented economy and political measures to limit imports such as tariffs. Selling goods abroad and keeping one's currency (again, gold) they hoped would result in having more money and thus being more wealthy. This idea is reasonable for the middleages where the difference between having and not having money can decide about which country is able to hire more mercenaries and has the potential to decide wars."
428,Leontief preferences,"You are missing a $\min$ operator just before the bracket. The utility maximization problem is as follows, $$\max \ \min [\alpha x_1, ..., \gamma x_3] \\ \ \ \text{such that} \ \ \lambda_1x_1 + ... + \lambda_3x_3 = M$$
Consider the case of two goods with utility $u$ given by $u(x) = \min[\alpha x_1, \beta x_2]$. At the optimum, what do you know about the relation between $\alpha x_1$ and $\beta x_2$? They must be equal, that is $$\alpha x_1 = \beta x_2$$ For if not, then assume without loss of generality that $\alpha x_1 > \beta x_1$. What is the utility of such choices of $x_1$ and $x_2$? It must be $\beta x_2$, which means that some of your money is being spent on $x_1$ (assuming prices are strictly positive) but it is not giving you any extra utility, and so this cannot be an optimal choice of consumption.

434,Is evolutionary game theory a useful modelling tool?,"You're looking at it from a particularly biological point of view. I know nothing of side-blotched lizards, but I can say that evolutionary game theory is often used for equilibrium selection. In games with more than one equilibrium (whether it be Nash or otherwise), evolutionary game theory can allow us to select a particular equilibrium that is a better prediction than others in that a population is, in some sense, more likely to reach it and stay there than it is to reach and stay at other equilibria. Have a look at Population Games and Evolutionary Dynamics by William H. Sandholm if you want to see more of how economists use evolutionary game theory. What your question gets at is really more about creating a model with evolution to describe an ecosystem rather than evolutionary game theory, though the two are not unrelated."
435,How is momentum justified as a common risk factor?,"The Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) paper is usually considered Original Source, though I'm sure you could find something earlier that looks similar if you looked hard enough."
436,Was the Concorde project an example of the sunk-cost fallacy?,"I doubt that the sunk-cost fallacy was a major reason why the Concorde project was pursued for so long (approved by the UK government 1962, entered commercial service 1976). Any ""emotional impact on British citizens"" that it was feared cancellation would cause would more likely have been due to a loss of national prestige (this was a time when many in Britain still - unrealistically - thought of their country as a great power).  "
437,Are obstructed views a negative externality?,"In general, yes it's an externality: it's a cost borne by others. How do we know it's a cost with real economic value? Because in general, properties with good light and better views tend to attract higher purchase prices and higher market rents."
438,Is indefinite exponential economic growth possible?,"As Steven Landsburg pointed out, indefinite anything isn't possible given the eventual heat death of the universe."
439,Examples of Factors in the ICAPM,"People have chosen different ways to pick factors. Chen, Roll and Ross are a classic example of attempts to find reasonable ICAPM factors. Fama-French factors are often explained as correlated with underlying ICAPM factors. Other researchers have chosen to look for factors without assuming outwardly observable exposures by analyzing returns using factor analysis or principal components."
440,Are low interest rates dangerous?,"If by dangerous it is meant they add possible downwards volatility of assets, that could easily be argued for as:"
441,Show that $W_t - \int_0^t \xi_s ds$ is forward-measure-Brownian,"(Looking at the question and notation used more closely, the formulation seems to be problematic in couple places.)"
442,How is software treated in Gross Domestic Product calculations?,The National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) are used to calculate GDP. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) prepares methodology papers discussing how they calculate various contributions to the NIPA. They happen to have one on software for business software and this paper should be of use:
443,Guess and Verify,Another somewhat canonical form is the value function for risk-sensitive preferences when consumption follows a random walk with drift (there are also versions including capital -- see Backus Ferriere Zin 2014).
444,Practical examples of fair division algorithms being used,"The easiest generalization, of envy free sharing of a heterogeneous cake between two cake eaters is quite common. My family growing up frequently used the you divide and I choose method for sharing a lone piece of dessert. Depending on what you'd accept for ""concrete example"", Abraham and Lot use this method to divide the land of Canaan.  A  two-stage fair division problem was used in the partitioning of Germany after World War II. The Talmud has examples of fair division rules, which though are only thought experiments, are thought to have been applied in the Jewish diaspora over inheritance matters. "
445,"Example of an economy where Equilibria may not be efficient, where one agent is altruistic","This is an old question. The first example of inefficiency caused by altruism that I know of is due to Winter, S. (1969). A Simple Remark on the Second Optimality Theorem of Welfare Economics. Journal of Economic Theory, 1, 99–103, but I am sure others were around before that."
446,The median as a welfare function,"John Rawls, in his book, A Theory of Justice, discusses the Maxi Min Principle, where he essentially says that societies can be compared based on how well they maximize the welfare of those with the lowest welfare (subject to caveats about certain basic human rights).  If the typical welfare function is a weighted average of individual welfare $U_i$ like: $$\sum a_i \cdot u_i$$ over all $i$, then this welfare function is $$\min u_i$$.
Since the minimum is the 0th percentile, I think this would just barely qualify as an answer to your question. I suspect that's not exactly what you had in mind, but it might be helpful. "
447,For what demand function is a monopoly most harmful?,An arbitrarily large ratio should occur with demand curve 
448,Understanding this particular criticism of RCTs by Deaton and Cartwright,"Without having read the full piece I'd say you are mostly spot on, but for a subtle difference. The objection runs a bit deeper than your rephrasing of it, where you refer to single estimate. The thing is that there are way more than a single estimate this applies to, and therefore you are more likely to be off."
449,Does economic theory support the notion that the wealth of the wealthy is based on the poverty of the poor?,Let me preface this answer with a word of caution: your question is a very good and important one but it is also one that depends tremendously on the definitions of the terms it uses. I'm going to attempt to answer it in the most unassuming and non-technical way. You could pose it in technical terms and get a more precise answer.
450,How/why does foreign investment get scared by the monetary policy?,Monetary policy affects the value of a country's currency (e.g. interest rate & money supply changes affect the value of cash).
451,Could leisure be considered a Giffen good?,I have two sources here:
452,Rationality and Common Belief in Rationality in Brandenburger & Dekel (1987),"The concept that Brandenburger and Dekel (1987) call an ""a posteriori equilibrium"" is roughly the same as what Dekel and Siniscalchi call an ""epistemic type structure for a complete information game"" in which all types are rational and there is common belief in rationality. Therefore, Brandenburger and Dekel's Proposition 2.1, together with the remark that immediately follows the proof of Propoistion 2.1, is roughly the same as Theorem 1 in Dekel and Siniscalchi.  "

455,Can higher working hours reduce productivity?,The closest study I could find was that by John Pencavel titled 'The Productivity of Working Hours.'
456,How and when is M0 money created?,First it is helpful to provide some definitions.
457,Why did large denomiations exist in the early 20th century?,"Even back in the 19th century, the American economist Dunbar reported then that 90% of all financial transactions were being performed as transfers using cheques or bills of payment."
458,Fair and efficient allocation of “family goods”,"Right now I'm not sure about the equivalence of the relabeling, and therefore the usefulness of this anwer -- see comments below."
459,Which economic research articles or books use anthropological methods?,"In economics, people usually use mathematics as an intermediary to understand some economic mechanisms that would be difficult to understand without maths. 
Economists usually focus more on mechanisms in an analytic way than some historical facts in these mechanisms. That's a little bit what it is said ""homo economicus"""
460,Kőszegi - Rabin (2006) model problem,"You can interprete $c_1 \in \{0,1\}$ as ""I have the tea"" and ""I don't have the tea"", and this tea is valued $v=13$. $c_2$ is just a wealth transfer, i.e., it is $-p$ if the tea is bought and $0$ if the purchase is rejected.
Gain-loss utility is assesed separately in each dimension. Such that 
$$n(c|r) = n_1(c_1|r_1) + n_2(c_2|r_2).$$"
461,Restricting “money creation” to the central bank [duplicate],"The proposal is to prohibit fractional reserve banking. So if enacted, Icelandic banks would have to have at least as much in reserves as they have in checking deposits. To do any lending, the bank would need to raise funds either from it's equity holders or by borrowing from investors. A number of US economists, such as Chicago economist John Cochrane, have endorsed this idea."
462,Credit Frictions as the source of Business Cycles,Yes credit frictions do have an amplifying effect on supply shocks while they often attenuate demand shocks and they also give increased persistent to the effects of the supply shocks in many models. 
463,Differentiation of the value function in Burdett Mortensen (1998),"When you take the integral of a $\max_{\{\cdot\}}$ operator, I think you have to split the integral into two separate integrals with different supports on them."
464,What is the percentage of announced Merger & Acquistion deals actaully completed?,"If I'm reading it correctly, Table X (page 2633) of Schwert (2000) (Journal of Finance, Hostility in Takeovers: In the Eyes of the Beholder?) says that about 78 percent of deals in 1975-1996 were successful. "
465,Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium,"Let the strategy of player 1 be represented by $(x1_1,xDD_1,xDC_1,xCD_1,xCC_1)$ where $x1$ is the first round action of player 1, $xDD_1$ is the action taken at the information set where both players have defected in the first round, $xDC_1$ is the action taken at the information set where player 1 has defected and player 2 has cooperated in round 1, etc.. Note that something like $(x1_1,x2_1)$ (with $x2_1$ being the action taken in round 2) is never a full specification of the strategy of player 1, since we need to specify behavior at each information set separately. Define the strategies of player 2 similarly. However, a perfect Bayesian equilibrium must also specify the beliefs of the player, $\mu_1,\mu_2$. This is an important part of the specification of an equilibrium. As we will see below, the question is geared towards understanding that a different equilibrium does not require the strategies to differ. A difference in beliefs is sufficient to count as a different equilibrium."
466,What models exists for explaining the price of nonrenewable resources?,"Based on my understanding, Hotelling's Rule is a pretty good first step. Like many first steps, it doesn't perform particularly well empirically. I would expect that when technological change is considered, in the very long run, it isn't too bad."
467,On the Ms. Exponential vs Ms. Hyperbolic vignette,I believe the money pump works like this:
468,Log-normality assumption in consumption based asset pricing,The typical two-period Lagrangian is

470,Identification with BBL,"After searching for a while, this is the best answer I can so far come up with."
471,Perfect Substitution with a Continuum of goods?,"Seems like the problem specified as specified right now should have as solution $C(\omega)=\frac{\delta(\omega)}{P(\omega)}$ if $P(\omega)=\min_{\omega'} P(\omega')$ and zero otherwise. The solution proposed cannot be optimal because the budget constraint is not depleted. If we let $\omega^*$ be the index of the cheapest good, the indirect utility would be then $U^*(P(w))=1/P(\omega^*)$. "
472,Thesis-advisor/student pairs that won the nobel prize,"This seemed like a fun exercise, so using just the info on Wikipedia, I was able to compile this:"
473,Would insurance plan be necessary if we had instant access to credit?,"As Dave Harris' points out in his comment, I assume that your question deals with events that do not compromise the individual's ability to work, which would prevent her from taking on debt."
474,What determines the exchange rate of two fiat currencies if the supply of each is known?,"There isn't any good way to rehabilitate the quantity theory when there are other currencies that are perfect substitutes for dollars - so in that sense, there isn't any answer to Landsburg's question. Indeed, the irrelevance of the quantity theory under perfect substitutability - which has always been theoretically clear - has become a practical reality recently, as reserves become a perfect substitute for other short-term nominal assets once the nominal interest rate hits zero."
475,eBay economics - total revenue impact from expanding ecosystem by 1 seller,"eBay seems to think that additional sellers increase its profit (not just revenue), because it advertises the option to sell on its website and tries to recruit more sellers. That's the empirical answer. "
476,Do companies have non compete agreements between each other?,"This is known as dividing markets or market allocation, and it is against the law in the US, the EU, and I imagine in most countries with antitrust laws."
477,Why teach Arrow's impossibility theorem?,"I see the important lesson of  the impossibility theorem as establishing that it is not generally speaking possible to have nicely behaved preferences of groups, even if individuals have nicely behaved preferences. Therefore a social welfare function may not exist . Attempts to improve aggregate welfare by maximizing the outcome of a preference aggregation mechanism may result in unfair or irrational outcomes. "
478,Is the Federal Reserve issuing money in a fair way?,"The Fed introduces money in the economy through the banks via the mechanism of fractional-reserve banking, as you mentioned in your article. 
This means the Fed is then allowing the banks to provide credit to anyone who they find adequate. The reason to do so is that banks will favor investment opportunities which lead to long term growth, such as build a house or a factory, rather than immediate consumption of goods, which would lead faster to inflation. The alternative would be to transfer the money to the government, which would distribute it through investments (like build roads) or subsidies."
479,R or Python for private sector economist/strategist,If you already know how to code in MATLAB then python is more similar to it than R so I would say you will have easier time to transitioning there. 
480,Graduate Level Textbook on Labor Economics and Macro-Labor,"There's also Labor Economics by Pierre Cahuc, Stéphane Carcillo, and André Zylberberg. It's a broader labor econ book, but The ""Unemployment and Inequality"" fourth of the book covers these topics. I have not seen the second edition, but I expect that they did not alter that part for the worse."
481,Can destruction be profitable?,"It can be profitable for the monopolist to do so. For the conventional producer who is a price taker the profit objective function looks like this:
$$\max_{q} \Pi^c $$
where $\Pi^c = P \cdot q - C(q)$."
482,Intuition - Why does elasticity vary along a curve?,Think of it this way. A yacht costs $\$0.01$. How much do you demand? Then double the price. Now how many would you demand?
483,Can A Utility Function Take On Negative Values?,"A utility function can certainly be negative. The utility function is nothing more than a way to represent a preference relationship. This is an important conceptual point. In several theorems that typically show up in introductory texts, we show that sets of preferences that satisfy certain regularity conditions can be represented as utility function."

486,Is market failure constant? What properly defines it?,I have to intervene to say that market failure and externality are not the same thing. So I do not think it is at all correct to define market failure as

488,Does Inflation Make Money Eventually Worthless?,"""Worth less"" than before - yes, that's exactly what inflation does."
489,When can economists claim to “understand” an event or phenomenon?,"I'm not sure there is a correct answer to this question (or if there is, we don't understand it yet!), but here's a first shot at an answer:"
490,Is there a journal for replications in experimental economics?,The Behavioral Economics Replication Project could be interesting for you. They presented their research at the 2016 American Economic Association Annual Meeting.
491,Problems with economic modelling: good textbooks/articles/papers?,"I recommend reading Dani Rodrik's new book, Economics Rules: The Rights and Wrongs of the Dismal Science. Rodrik supports the use of mathematics as bringing clarity of meaning, and argues that the subject is far more applied and empirical than its detractors realize."
492,How to derive firm's cost function from production function?,"""I am not given wealth $w$ although I suppose I could assume any firm who
  is purchasing has some budget."""
493,Why did the Federal Reserve change the data about USA GDP?,"@BB King's answer is good, but I want to make one point very clear:"
494,Why should I get a bond with negative interest instead of having a bank deposit account either zero interest or positive interest,"It makes little sense to me either, but here are some possible reasons for buying a bond with negative interest rates rather than depositing the same amount in a bank:"
495,How is the interest on fractional reserve money creation paid?,"Repayment of interest does require an expansion of the money supply, but not in a way that is inflationary. "
496,Are there any examples of tariffs working?,"I interpret your question more broadly as one about whether protectionism has ever ""worked"". Two economists that think it has are Chang Ha-Joon and Dani Rodrik. You can therefore look up their work."
497,Why doesn't Barnes and Noble just lower its prices?,Kling's maxim: Price Discrimination Explains Everything
498,Why lower the deposit rate if it is already negative?,You are assuming that the supply of deposits is zero when the price (the rate) is zero but it definitely is not. There are several reasons for this. 
499,Doesnt convexity prevent thick indifference curves aswell?,My approach would be to define thick indifference curves in terms of a stronger form of local non-satiation:
500,How much money is wire transferred every year worldwide?,"If you're just trying to understand the volume of electronic transactions generally to an order of magnitude, it's in the quadrillions of dollars per year. According to this document from the US Treasury, SWIFT handles about \$5 trillion per day, or given about 250 business days per year, about \$1.25 quadrillion dollars a year. "
501,Application of Poisson process in economic modelling,"Most of the literature on ""Strategic experimentation"" (or Bandits) uses Poisson processes. Here players can use either a risky or safe arm and one of them generates a fixed stream of payoffs (usually the safe arm) the other one generates lump-sum payments whose arrival times are described by a Poisson process."
502,What institutions are examples of “shadow banking”?,"While whomever told you about ""shadow banking"" in China is correct that in an international context, the term can often refer to informal banking arrangements (the earliest use of the term); however, these days, it is usually used in the sense first coined by Paul McCulley in a speech he delivered (""Teton Reflections"") at the 2007 Jackson Hole conference. He described them as:"
503,Game Theory Book,I will also recommend The Art of Strategy by Dixit and Nabebuff.
504,How does buying/selling houses affect the GDP?,"There is only a change in GDP to the extent there are market goods and services used in the sale and only those goods and services are counted. The actual sales revenue are irrelevant. For example, the home inspection, appraisal, brokerage fees, and, I believe mortgage closing costs, would be in GDP. If you and your sister swapped houses in as-is condition without getting the market, bank, or tax authority involved, there would be no change in GDP.  "

506,"How is Singapore able to provide first-world public services, given its low income tax rate?","I'm not an expert on this, but as a Singaporean, here are some factors off the top of my head (plus some Googling), explaining why Singapore is different from other first-world countries (in terms of revenue and expenditures)."
507,Doesn't the concept of marginal utility speak to a cardinal utility function?,"To the pure ordinalist who believes that preferences are purely ordinal, the concept of marginal utility (MU) has no meaning. (And a fortiori, the concept of diminishing MU also has no meaning.)"

509,Constant Elasticity of Substitution: Special Cases,"We know that if $u$ represents $\succeq$ on $X$, then for any strictly increasing function $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, then $v(x) = f(u(x))$ represents $\succeq$ on $X$"
510,Condorcet's paradox: Is the majority rule transitive?,"As you stated, transitivity is that overall $x \succeq y$ and $y \succeq z$ implies $x \succeq z$. I will show an example where majority rule isn't transitive and hopefully it will answer your question."
511,Why do top professional sport players get usually paid so much?,"A proper answer should have some evidence, perhaps I will add that when I have more time."
512,What is the true source of dynamic(Pareto) inefficiency in OLG models?,"Shell 1971 argues (in a ten page paper, so read it!) that the dynamic inefficiency stems from the double infinity of traders and goods, and not the dynamics. This allows us to do the Hilbert hotel switch."
513,Bayesian Nash Equilibrium - Mixed Strategies,"I believe that the answer given by @denesp is incorrect. The second method involves simply writing the game in strategic of ""normal"" form. I believe
the first method is better (easier to use), but I think that they can both be used.
In the answer given by @desesp, the following explanation is given."
514,What is the usefulness of approximating an optimal decision rule that close enough to steadystate in RBC model?,Side note: This is one way of solving it - the alternative would be formulating a Bellman equation and iterating on that.
515,Simple Sketch of Mirrlees 1971,"You can find a didactic exposition of Mirrlees (1971) -- including derivations of optimal tax schedule formulas for different social welfare and utility function -- in section 4.2 of ""The Economics of Taxation"" by Bernard Salanié (2003, First Edition)."
516,Are there any instances where short run demand/supply is more elastic than long run cases?,It is possible.  We normally think demand and supply are more elastic in the long run because consumers/firms have more options in the long run.  For example if gas becomes more expensive consumers can buy more more fuel efficient cars.

521,What are good books about monopolies and market failures?,"Your question is quite broad in the sense that various forms of market failure cover a significant portion of all of microeconomics. I presume you have already looked in a general undergraduate micro book such as Varian's Intermediate Microeconmics, which provide coverage of many of these topics."
522,Is the mainstream against agent based modelling?,"I'm an outsider, so I can't speak of what the boards of prestigious economic journals think of this, but..."
523,What is the average economic value of a human life?,"It depends on the context, of course, but most often in policy analysis ""the value of a life"" has nothing (directly) to do with output, etc, but instead means the maximum amount that people would want the government to spend in order to save a randomly chosen life.  "
524,How is money created on net?,"No, it's not correct to say that extra cash money comes into the world as interest paid on the reserve accounts of commercial banks."
525,Why is the inverted yield curve a good predictor of impending economic recession?,"There is a fair amount of ambiguity to this question. The first question is: what is the yield curve? A fixed income investor may refer to the yields across all maturities as the yield curve, while economists pick the difference in yields between two arbitrary maturities as the yield curve. Which two? Typical choices are the spread between the 2-year and 10-year bond, or the spread between the 3-month Treasury bill rate and the 10-year. The quality of a recession indicator depends which pair you choose."
526,Destruction in Exchange Economies,"Consider an exchange economy with two goods $x$ and $y$ and two agents $A$ and $B$. The utility functions are
$$
U_A(x_A,y_A) = x_A \cdot y_A, \hskip 20pt U_B(x_B,y_B) = \min(x_B,y_B).
$$
Let the initial endowments be
$$
\omega_A = (\omega_A^x,\omega_A^y) = (z,0), \hskip 20pt \omega_B = (\omega_B^x,\omega_B^y) =  (0,4),
$$
where $0 \leq z \leq 8$ is left as a parameter. In equilibrium
$$
x_A = \frac{z}{2}, \hskip 20pt y_A = \left(4 - \frac{z}{2}\right), \hskip 20pt x_B = \frac{z}{2}, \hskip 20pt  y_B = \frac{z}{2}.
$$
(A detailed calculation showing this is at the bottom of this answer.)"
527,What are alternative measures of risk?,"A variance is an incomplete measure of risk in a sense, that it measures uncertainty in security payoffs, rather than uncertainty in holder's welfare. In the simplest way we can demonstrate this point as follows."
528,Core elements of Marxist Economics,"From reading a selection of writings by Marx, I have come to understand the following three as the core elements of Marxian economics. "

Under incomplete information you might not even know what game you are into. "
532,Reading list: history of economic thought / political economy,"As a first read in these fields I would recommend J K Galbraith's A History of Economics. It covers, in a concise and highly readable way, major developments in economic thought from ancient times until around 1980, making links with major economic and political events."

537,What are the pros and cons of eliminating corporate taxes?,The first and most important insight here is to recognize that burden of taxation (the incidence) need not fall on the entity taxed. Economist Herb Stein is famous for having quipped (on the subject of the corporate income tax): 
538,Deriving the Euler Equation,"The question is quite straightforward, and you do not need the first
step that you have. You have (for some reason) a different multiplier
here for each time period. That is not the case- you simply have a
no-ponzi scheme condition, aka a transversality constraint. The problem
is expressed as $max\,\sum\beta^{t}U(c_{t})$ st $c_{t}+k_{t+1}\leq f(k_{t})$.
The stream of utility to the agent is $U=\sum\beta^{t}U(c_{t})=U(c_{0})+....\beta^{t}U(c_{t})+\beta^{t+1}U(c_{t+1})+...+\beta^{T}U(c_{T}).$"
539,Mathematical open problems that (when answered) might unlock MAJOR mathematical (micro)economics/finance/econometrics discoveries,"People have argued that if $P \neq NP$ then efficient markets are impossible and certain equalibria may not exist. However, they may hold approximately, so I'm not sure if this qualifies. Additionally, if it turns out that $P=NP$ then certain economic optimization problems (e.g. in logistics) become easily solvable. On the other hand, if $P \neq NP$ then it might imply that encryption is very safe and therefore certain forms of economic arrangements will still be possible in the face of technological advance.  "
540,Is elasticity purely an aggregate concept or can it be individualized,"In theory, the elasticity quantifies in proportional terms the ""reaction"" of the dependent variable to a change of the independent variable, where the two are related through a functional relationship. So the concept is universal and mathematical -it applies to any univariate function, and not only in the field of Economics (when we have a multivariate function, then partial elasticities can be defined and used, but they face some constraints). So there is nothing ""intrinsically aggregate"" about the concept. In its theoretical conceptualization. "
541,Is there always a pure Nash equilibrium in a resource selection game?,"Yes, there is always a pure Nash equilibrium. See:"

544,Calibration of utility function parameters controlling labor disutility,$\alpha$ handles the conversion between the units in which labor is measured and the the units in which consumption is measured. 
545,Why is CRRA utility often used in macroeconomics DSGE model?,"Models at Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium level must be able to replicate real economies to an acceptable degree. One of the features of real economies has been a relatively stable growth rate (see also this post), $\dot x/x=\gamma$, where the dot above a variable denots the derivative with respect to time."
546,How successful will OPEC's predatory dumping strategy be?,This is the cost curve of oil production (North American shale at $65):
547,Is there empirical evidence on usability of Cobb-Douglas production function?,"The simple answer to why the Cobb-Douglas functional form is used is because it is at least a log-linear approximation to some higher-order production function. That is, suppose you take a functional form that looks like this: $\log Y_t = f(A, K, L)$. Then a linear approximation would look like the Cobb-Douglas production function. (For a small $1\%$ increase in $K$, we get approximately an $\alpha \%$ increase in $Y$.)"
548,Interchangeability between knowing an event obtains with probability 1 and knowing an event obtains with absolute certainty?,"If you take the standard Aumann model, but allow for states occuring with probability zero, you can taje some nonempty event $N$ such that for the agents prior $p$, one has $p(N)=0$. Let $K\cap N=\emptyset$ and $p(K)>0$. If the agent knows $K\cup N$ but not $K$, then she assigns probability $1$ to $K$, even though she does not know $K$."

552,Predicting $y$ when response variable is $\ln(y)$,"You do not find the same answer because of what I suspect to be a typographical error, which would thus be the main reason of your problem: $x_{03}$ would be set to $80$, not $8$. Another possibility, if you keep $x_{03}=8$, is an error in the second estimated coefficient, say, $\hat{\beta}_2 = -0.1$ instead of $-0.01$."

554,Instrumental variables vs control function: Which approach and why to handle endogeneity?,"The Control Function Approach (proposed by Heckman-1979 if I remember correctly) , is similar to an IV strategy in spirit, except that it can be used in a non-linear setting, such as Probit/Logit models etc. For instance, if you have endogeneity in a logit model, you cannot just run a 2SLS procedure as the first step is a linear projection of your x on your z, and the second step is nonlinear. There are two ways of handling endogeneity in nonlinear models: control function approach and a special regressor approach. "
555,Could a Cap-and-Trade and a Carbon Tax both work together as a system to reduce carbon emissions?,"The combination of the two policies could work and would have some advantages over either alone, and for a given reduction in emissions the overall cost burden on industry and consumers would not be doubled.  However, the cap on emissions would weaken the effect of gradual escalation of the tax rate."

560,How time zones affects causality?,"I'm skeptical that this will work. I'm concerned that for the sort of shock that is large enough to be interesting and large enough to study that stock prices will move before they open. You could potentially measure this by looking at the changes in stock price from close to open, but I'm not sure what you'd be measuring. Are changes in Tokyo stock prices in any meaningful sense causing the changes in NYSE price? Or is it simply that all stock prices are moving at once, but you can't easily see the NYSE stock prices until the exchange opens? "
561,Do people really care about higher moments?,"Perhaps there is some evidence toward your claim, but I would argue that in most situations, people do not use point estimates (although some ""smoothing"" likely occurs). In particular, there is no doubt that people care about the second movement (variance). The commonly employed, and robustly empirically documented, notion of risk aversion captures exactly this. Given two risky prospects with the same expectation (say different assets) it seems that most people prefer the one with lower variance (i.e., the less risky prospect). Think: which would you chose when given the option between \$50 for sure or a 50/50 toss up between \$0 and \$100? The difference between these two options is entirely in their second moment. "

In part, this may be due to difficulties in measuring food waste, as noted by a commenter. However, a more fundamental difficulty stems from a lack of 'exogenous' variation in food waste. The amount of food waste may vary significantly between places and times, but so do other factors (taxes, technology, consumer demand) which also influence the price of food."

575,Why does savings equal investment (scenario)?,"To clarify the first scenario: you assume Joe can buy this car. However, Joe has to either earn an income (and therefore, produce something himself) or he has to dissave. In the first case, Joe has produced 500 output and earned an income of 500. He spends his income on a car, but Amanda saves the money. As is clarified in other answers, Joe's output goes to inventories (because not purchased by Amanda), which are counted as (unplanned) investments. S = I = 500, C = 500, Y = S + C = 1000. You mention in a comment that most consumers do not produce something. In fact, they do. At work, when earning their income (with which they buy the car), they created added value (this is the production (500) that goes to the inventory when Amanda does not buy it). Think of the income they earn at work as their part in the created added value, their contribution to real production. Consider the second case when Joe does not work."

The US (the country as a whole, not the government) bought goods and services from rest of the world by selling them IOUs. So far, the world has been content to let the US roll over these obligations. If the world decided that they wanted to trade these IOUs for goods and services, the US would have to start running current account surpluses and shipping goods abroad to pay for its past current account deficits. These surpluses have to come from somewhere, and they would result in less consumption and less investment in the US economy."

605,Pricing a European call option while absence of arbitrage is violated,"I believe there is not a unique price. Say, instead of buying the option  you spent 0.5 on a half a unit of the asset $S^2_1$ This asset pays out $[0.4, 0.6, 0.8]$ which first order stochastically dominates the option. So, no matter your probability beliefs about the states,  in that setting you'd never pay $0.5$ for the option which pays less in every state. This suggests the right price is less than $0.5$. Similarly, buying $0.25$ units of the $S^0_1$ asset or $0.167$ units of the $S^1_1$ asset would likewise stochastically dominate the option. In fact, because for $0.375$ units of asset $S^1_2$, which costs on $0.375$, you can still have an asset that pays out $[0.3, 0.45, 0.6]$, it seems unlikely that the price could even be as high as $0.375$. Asset 0 implies a price below $0.4$ and asset 1 below $0.45$"
606,Why are nations engaging in austerity when bond yields are historically low?,"Debt being cheaper than ever doesn't mean that it is optimal to borrow.

As usual, Kreps' style helps: he has the ability to seamlessly inject his -always formal- approach with very down-to-earth comments and examples that are strong in intuition (and he does it better than Savage, I might add). But also, here ""formal"" does not translate into ""complete exposition"": he explicitly refrains from formally proving parts of the whole apparatus, mentioning that ""this is a two-page proof"", and ""this is another two-page proof"", and ""if you want to prove this, good luck"". For these parts he falls back on Fishburn's (1970) ""Utility Theory for Decision Making"" book, chapter 14 ""Savage's Expected Utility Theory"". And Fishburn is formal alright (more symbols than words in a page).  "

633,Problem with defining liquidity,"As a concept to measure the interchangeability of assets and money, liquidity is a new word. It first appears in 1923 in a use by Hawtrey (The Oxford English Dictionary (1989)). The underlying idea however is much older. Menger (1892) calls a good more or less saleable according to the facility to which it can be disposed of at current purchasing prices with less or more diminution. He is talking about the origin of money, and not the disposition of financial assets, but this concept of saleability is very much like the modern concept of liquidity. This sense of saleability goes back at least as far as Jehan Palsgrave's usage in 1530 (The Oxford English Dictionary (1989)). Although the absence of liquidity is now commonly referred to as ""illiquidity"", Marschak (1938) offers ""frozen"" as an alternative that did not catch on."

656,Nash equilibrium of a Bertrand game with different marginal costs,"Yes, there is no equilibrium in pure strategies. For any price charged by firm 2 above $c_1$, firm one could only best respond by charging the largest price that is strictly smaller. which is impossible. If both firms charge at most $c_1$, one of these firms must make a loss, which cannot be a best response. So there is no Nash equilibrium in pure strategies."

658,Why could interest rates go up if Brexit happens?,"What would happen in the event of a ""Leave"" vote in the referendum? Well, the pound would quickly fall in value against its major trading partners - and some falls have already happened as the ""Leave"" vote appears to increase in probability. That makes imports more expensive, which is directly inflationary. Which pushes the Bank of England (the UK's Central Bank) to raise interest rates in response."
659,Why do people trade derivatives?,"There are number of reasons to use derivatives. How practical the following are? It, in turn, depends on the costs compared to the importance (utility) of the case. The costs can be substantial."
660,What are some critiques to the principle of comparative advantage?,"One of the most common critiques is that the standard model is a static analysis.  While a country might be better off today by focusing on its comparative advantage, its longer term prospects depend on the future of that industry, particularly on how quickly productivity can be improved."
661,What is Negative Interest Rate?,"An interest rate is the percentage that is paid for borrowing money, and that one gets for lending. If it is negative that means you have to pay so that someone takes your money for a while. So how could that even work, why should anyone lend money under such conditions? Normal savers would just keep their money with them, even if that bears the risk that it might get stolen more easily than from a bank. What can however happen is that the real interest rate is lower than zero and people still keep their money at the bank. The real interest rate is the (nominal) interest rate minus inflation. In times of high inflation this can easily happen, and as you see here in the world bank data it frequently happens in many countries: http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FR.INR.RINR"
662,How wealthy are modern day humans compared to preindustrial times?,There is significant debate about whether such x exists.

664,What is an example application of a quasilinear utility function?,"Quasilinear utility functions are useful in much of the demand estimation literature, particularly in discrete choice. For instance, check out Berry 1994,Berry Levinsohn Pakes 1995 and the many applications in Nevo's papers on demand estimation (here's a ""practicioner's guide"").

669,What fraction of new businesses die out within a year?,"The Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS) of the Census provides annual measures of business dynamics (such as job creation and destruction, establishment births and deaths, and firm startups and shutdowns) for the economy and aggregated by establishment and firm characteristics. The use of the LBD as its source data permits tracking establishments and firms over time. In particular, BDS provides information on Establishment openings and closings and Number of startups and firm shutdowns. "
670,Can a game with a unique pure strategy Nash equilibrium also have a mixed strategy equilibria?,"In general:
 If you draw the numbers of the payoff matrix from continuous i.i.distributions then with probability 1 the game will have an odd number of equilibrium points. (Meaning the sum total of pure and mixed equilibria.)

675,Ambiguous definition of Substitution and Income effect?,"First, you can make any definition you want as long as you use it consistently, but it's usually better to adopt the standard definition if you want to avoid confusion.   Similarly you could ask why we don't call a garage a dogpound and a dogpound a garage.  We perfectly well could, but it's better if we all use words the same way."
676,Which areas of mathematical knowledge are required for understanding different genres of theoretical economics literature (and at which level)?,"For microeconomic theory, a starting point would be"
677,"If the price of oil and energy goes down, why does CPI go up?","Canadian prices will tend to rise when energy prices fall because Canada tends to export oil and import other things. As a major oil exporter, a fall in the price of oil decreases the value of the Canadian currency— because foreigners have less need to purchase Canadian dollars with which to buy oil— causing other things to be more expensive to purchase (due to an increase in the prices of imported production inputs and finished goods)."

679,Why are there fewer high schools than elementary schools?,Two relevant economic principles are:
680,What is the point of silent auctions?,But perhaps this is not always the case. The price might have been so high that you would not have been willing to bid above it. In fact it might have been so high that the no one but the highest bidder would have given that bid. Knowing this the highest bidder could decrease his bid. In fact in English auctions (non-silent rising bid auctions) the final price is the second highest valuation of the unique good. In the auction you describe (a sealed bid first price auction) the final price is usually somewhat random based on what people believe about each others valuations and each others bidding strategies. It can happen that the final price is higher than it would have been in an English auction because one of the bidders overvalued what his competition would be willing to pay. So the English auction is not clearly advantegous.
681,Consumer surplus in case of perfectly inelastic demand,"From a purely theoretical perspective, if an individual's demand curve is perfectly inelastic, then her willingness to pay for the good is infinite. NB this also implies that she has an infinite budget. Thus, consumer surplus is well defined: it is the willingness to pay minus the price she pays, so as long as the price is finite her consumer surplus is finite."
682,"How does US (its economy, banks, industry) profit from dollar being the “standard currency”?",Some major benefits include:
683,Economic consequences of a lingua franca,"These two papers seem relevant. The large Indian wage premium for English language fluency suggests that there would be significant returns at the margin to providing services through trade instead of locally, but they are limited by the supply of foreigners with the right language skills.  However, these premiums are largest among the skilled workers, suggesting that the benefits of a universal language would also accrue disproportionately (in absolute wage premia) to the most skilled.   "
684,Elasticity of demand equals -1 but income decreases!,We discourage numeric questions as they are unlikely to be useful for future visitors but this is a very good example of why using non-marginal quantities can be misleading.
685,Fractional reserve banking and the value of someone else's currency,"It is the policy of pretty much every central bank on the planet to supply reserves on demand when private banks request (in return for assets). But a central bank in country B can not do this, it can not create new dollars. So if dollar based fractional reserve banking were to start up in country B, it would behave rather differently to everyone else's fractional reserve banking."
686,"Do perfect complements have to be normal goods? If so, why?",A good is normal if its demand is increasing in income. So let $p_x$ and $p_y$ be the price of the goods with quantities $x$ and $y$ and let $m$ be income.
687,Empirical estimates of CRRA and CARA utility,"In Babcock, B. A., Choi, E. K., & Feinerman, E. (1993). Risk and probability premiums for CARA utility functions. Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics, 17-24. (downloadable) we find the following table (the first column is the coefficient of absolute risk aversion)"
688,why is labor $h_t$ often average working time percentage of non-sleeping time in RBC?,"Specifications of this form treat labor $h_t$ and leisure $1-h_t$ as two alternative ways of spending a total time endowment.  Labor can be used as an input to the production function, while leisure enters directly into the utility function as a desirable end in its own right."
689,How does inflation impact the welfare of the economy?,"First, there are direct negative effects from inflation, known as the shoe leather cost and menu costs of inflation. These are direct costs which come from price changes: People will carry less cash, need to update their knowledge about prices, firms need to update their prices and wages, and similar. These are usually small, but typically higher given higher inflation rates."
690,Can a country survive and prosper without international trade or investment from overseas?,"In principle and in theory, anything can happen.
First, as always, we have to supply some more specific content for ""survive and prosper"". Are we assuming some preferences underlying the whole issue? If yes, then what kind of preferences are they? What kind of material goods and services do these preferences favor? Can these material goods and services be provided by the country's own resources, and to what degree?  "
691,What does economics say about “price gouging” during an emergency?,"Actually economics does not even officially use term price gouging. Your analysis is right, actually economists dislike anti-price gauging legislation for this reason. "

693,Is the economy a zero-sum game?,"Yes, it's possible, as long as the money is invested in ways that increase production by 4%. The economy is certainly not a zero sum game -- if it was, then it couldn't grow."
694,Why does the Laffer curve for consumption have no peak?,"This is not a general result. As the auhtors describe in page 10 of their paper, the result obtains only when government lump-sum transfers $s$ do not vary with tax revenues, and instead government spending $g$ does. Then consumption taxes do not affect labor supply, for any level of the tax rate. The relation becomes monotonic, and the Laffer curve with respect to the consumption tax rate becomes also monotonic. This is something that the authors are not very clear in the main text, but it can be detected in the various proofs at the end: they do not argue that the Laffer curve with respect to all three tax rates examined (consumption, labor, capital), becomes monotonic. Only its dimension with respect to the consumption tax."
695,Pure exchange economy: Given an initial endowment are multiple equilibria possible?,Yes. The Debreu version of the Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu theorem guarantees that excess demand has to satisfy very little restrictions if there are as many consumers as commodities.
696,List of production functions that satisfy the Inada conditions,"The Wikipedia statement should come with a citation or proof, as it is not entirely accurate: Cobb-Douglas functions with increasing returns to scale do not necessarily satisfy the Inada conditions, e.g., $f(x_1,x_2) = x_1^2x_2^2$ does not."
697,Does every allocation have a maximal Pareto-improvement?,I think there is a short proof if you also assume that the number of agents $n$ is finite and that the preferences are continuous.
698,First paper to introduce the “principal-agent problem”,"The term principal-agent problem is due to Ross (1973) (per Stiglitz, 1989). Other early contributions to this literature include Mirrlees (1974, 1976) and Stiglitz 1974, 1975)."

700,Understanding the shape of a Marginal Cost Curve,"I'll offer a less algebraic alternative to Alecos's answer. In short, yes and no."
701,What is the opportunity cost of doing something in your spare time?,"There is a crucial detail missing in the scenario you describe.  Is the worker working a five day week (and no more) because that is what their terms of employment require?  Or do they have the option of doing additional paid work (at the same rate, and for as many hours as they wish) at weekends, but on this occasion have opted to work only five days in the week?  If the latter, then it is clear that the opportunity cost of mowing the lawn is the value of the time taken at the wage rate."
702,Comparative dynamics in forward-looking equation,"The moment an unknown and unknowable in advance future quantity enters an optimal solution, we have no other option than to insert in its place some estimation of it. The more widely used such estimation (but not the only one) is the conditional expectation. Conditional on $t$, everything except $s_{t+1}$ will be treated as a constant. Since we do not know how exactly $s_{t+1}$ enters the $f$-function, we write in abstract notation as a function:"
703,Accounting for machines in the labor theory of value,"""I have read that the Labour Theory of Value holds that the value of a good or service is determined by the total amount of labour involved in its production.""
That would be Adam Smith's version of the LTV, which according to him only holds in pre-capitalist societies. 
Karl Marx's version is thus:
the value of a good or service is determined by the total amount of socially-necessary labor involved in its production.
Socially necessary labor is basically the average amount of labor a society (industry, trading network or whatever) requires to produce a good. 
It takes far less labor time on average to produce randomly mixed chemicals than to produce penicillin from chemical precursors. "
704,Consequences of hyperbolic discounting,"As often with models embodying some form of ""irrationality"" (whatever that means), HD does a great job at matching a whole lot of behaviors, but leaves room for rather annoying Dutch Book situations (also know as ""money pump"" situations). These suggest that HD might generate some inaccurate predictions, and induce undesirable behaviors when included in models."
705,Why has increased productivity over the last 100 years not affected how much people work?,"Let's work such a very simple model. We have a Robinson Crusoe island economy, an isolated individual that lives totally alone. In order to consume something Crusoe must work. Assume for even more simplicity that capital is not needed (say, fruit-gathering by hand). Crusoe does not like to work but he would rather sit relaxed and enjoy the good weather in his island. Apart from the biological necessity to eat something, Crusoe also likes the taste of fruits he gathers. Fruits cannot be stored."
706,Computational economics,Taken right from the society for computational economics:
707,Meaning of $dF(z)$ in expected utility framework,"Not all cdf’s have a density function, (for example if $F$ is not differentiable). However, when they do have a density, the notation $dF(z)$ is equivalent to $f(z)dz$. When performing integrals. However, even if the density does not exists, you can still write the expectation using the notation $dF(z)$. The details of what it actually means and the subtle differences can be learned in any measure theory course. But hopefully this short explanation helps you not freak out every time you see that notation."

714,Conventional Monetary Policy and Income Inequality,"Well, certainly you'll see literature saying it is possible to make monetary redistributive. This paper by Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2012), Redistributive Monetary Policy, says that deflation can cause redistributive effects in an economy, and that monetary policy can be used to correct that, but ""shouldn't"" be used as a redistributive tool beyond that correction."

718,Concave production function implies convex cost function,"Given the fixed input price $w$, the cost function can be written as
$$
C(q)=f^{-1}(q)\times w
$$
where $f^{-1}$ is the inverse of the production function $f$. From the discussion here, one can conclude that the inverse of a concave strictly increasing function is convex. Thus, $C(q)$ is convex as well. "
719,How is labor disutility modeled in Arrow-Debreu model?,"In the Arrow-Debreu model, households are endowed with some commodities, producers can use feasible production plans to transform commodities, and households ultimately consume commodities - which they choose optimally given their preferences subject to budget constraints. "
720,Why are banks allowed to resell mortgages?,"A bank selling mortgages does not, by itself, increase the money supply."
721,Are there conventions in economics for coding the distance between states?,"I think the answer depends on who is impacted by your measure of distance and for what purpose. Kennan and Walker (2011) Econometrica measure distance between states as ""the great circle distance between population centroids"" in an attempt to model moving costs. They also include an indicator for whether or not the state is adjacent. "

726,"Why is the Australian dollar, often viewed by traders as a proxy for the Chinese economy?","China's currency, the yuan (CNY), only partially reflects what goes on
  in China's economy. It doesn't trade freely; the Chinese government
  sets an official rate for it every day and only allows it to fluctuate
  1 percent around that level every day. In fact, it doesn't even vary
  that much; the average difference between the high and the low price
  last year was a mere 0.15 percent.   However, there is a version of
  the yuan (CNH) that trades freely overseas. The government doesn't fix
  a value for that, but as its value never strays that far from the
  value of the yuan, it too is relatively stable. The result is that the
  currency, whether traded on the mainland or overseas, only reacts
  modestly to Chinese economic indicators and other news that would be
  market-moving in other, freely traded currencies."
727,Empirical ranking of firms based on productivity,"There is a scientific tradition of decades that occupies itself with the measurement/estimation of the productivity/efficiency of firms.

735,Why don't prices of USA labor and Mexican labor equalise?,The underlying reason for persistent wage differences is probably that Mexican workers are less productive than American workers.
736,"In auction theory, why is my own valuation a random variable?","In most of the literature I have read on private value auctions you do actually know your own valuation in the auction, it is your private information. It has a distribution from the point of view of others, who can only guess at your valuation."
737,What is a rational consumer?,"In consumer theory, preferences are called rational if they are transitive and complete. Some nomenclature: An alternative A is weakly preferred to another alternative B, if you either like A more than B or you are indifferent between the two. Transitive means that whenever an alternative A is weakly preferred to alternative B, and B is weakly preferred to C, then A is weakly preferred to C. Complete means that for any two elements A and B of the set of possible alternatives, either A is weakly preferred to B, B is weakly preferred to A, or both. In short, preferences are rational when they are defined for all possible alternatives, and when they don't contradict each other in obvious ways."

741,What are the best books for developing a solid understanding of fundamentals of Economics?,"Read Hal Varian's textbook ""Microeconomic Analysis"". It's brief, yet a standard text in a 4th year or graduate course in advanced micro.  Then grab a good book on mathematical economics that's actually well written, and includes suggestions on how to develop good mathematical intuition, not just a bunch of recipes on how to solve problems.  For example, you can learn how to use determinants in matrix algebra, but how many actually know what a determinant is, both algebraically and geometrically? That's the blood, sweat, and tears bit, I think.   I suggest the two volumes by Knut Sydsaeter (check Amazon)"

743,Why do banks and stock exchanges close/have fixed hours?,"The answer is simple and it is due to the conduct of business and conditions relating to the early days of exchanges and banks. Then, there was no interest in trading  or providing liquidity to companies 24 hours a day and there was no coordination with the other parts of the world. Today, it is more like preserving the tradition, and just look at how NYSE opens at every morning, the good old bell is there to kick start the business. Today, it may make sense to have 24/7 financial services provision as we are living in the age of internet. "

746,Can savings and poverty coexist?,"First we must address the nature of savings. Savings are not bad or good per se. It depends on the context. It is true that in the short run, increased savings will lower consumption, thereby lowering GDP. However savings also increase investment, which in the long run increases economic growth. Therefore, the optimal savings rate is found by solving the trade-off between the short and long-term. "
747,Solution Method for Infinite-Horizon Maximization Problem,"Your first question (regarding constraints on the parameters) can be answered through first and second derivative analysis.

On this definition the service provided by a fire service would always be rival, because (even with plenty of capacity in terms of fire engines and staff) each visit to attend a fire involves some extra cost (eg vehicle fuel)."

782,Establish demand curve with infrequent sales,If you are fairly confident that your current price is not too far from the real profit-maximising price then there is little loss in accuracy from assuming the demand curve to be locally linear (i.e. a straight line in the area around your current point). This is illustrated in the figure below: note how the red (linear) approximation to the curve much more closely follows the shape of the curve when the two endpoints are close together than when they are far apart.

785,Shopping example in Kőszegi / Rabin (2006),I think it is just a matter of definition. The disutility from spending on the shoes is not the utility obtained by purchasing the shoes: it is the difference between the utility obtained when she does not buy the shoes and the utility she gets when she buys them.

787,Local Non-Satiation Proof,"Assume for a contradiction that there exists $y$ such that $p\cdot y<w$ and $u(y)\geq u(x^\ast)$. Let 
$$\epsilon^\ast= \frac{w-p\cdot y}{ \sum_i p_i}.$$ Then, for all $y'$, if $\ \|y - y'\| < \epsilon^\ast$, we would have $\left|y_i-y_i'\right|<\epsilon^\ast$. Notice that the cost of any bundle $y'$ would satisfy
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
p\cdot y' &=& p_1 y'_1 + p_2 y'_2 + \dots +p_n y'_n\\
&<&p_1 (y_1+\epsilon^\ast) + p_2 (y_2+\epsilon^\ast) + \dots +p_n (y_n+\epsilon^\ast)\\
&=& p\cdot y+\epsilon^\ast\sum_i p_i \\
&=&p\cdot y + \frac{w-p\cdot y}{ \sum_i p_i} \sum_i p_i\\
&=& w

Under Shared Spaces the vast majority of formal and informal road signage is removed, such as stop signs, traffic lights, raised curbs, road lines. The idea is that these signs makes pedestrians and drivers run follow the signs instead of watching the road and the people on it. When their attention is redirected to city streets and the people on them the hope is that a safer and faster spontaneous order will result. This has been tried in a number of places, most famously Drachten, Netherlands. A study of the Drachten experiment indicated that this caused a significant reduction in traffic accidents in the town.

808,Why does supply equal demand?,"I am not entirely sure if I can agree to the OP's comment that the disequilibrium analysis depends on price setting. I would rather argue that the analysis depends on quantity selection. With 1000 buyers and sellers in a market, where each seller is a firm and the market equilibrium price is $P^e$ and quantity $Q^e$, a single seller will produce $q_i^e$ such that $P^e = MC_i(q_i^e)$. "
809,Stock pricing with cross ownership,"The way I would think of this is as follows. Let us write the value
of the first company as $V_{A}$and the second as $V_{B}.$ Given
your definition, let me know if you agree with the following argument:
$$
V_{A}=s_{AA}\sum_{t=0}^{\infty}\pi_{tA}+s_{AB}\sum_{t=0}^{\infty}\pi_{tB}
$$
 Where $s_{AA}$ denotes the time invariant share of company A that
comapny A owns and $s_{BA}$ denotes the share of the company B that
A owns. Moreover, $\pi_{t}=A_{t}-L_{t}$ or the equity of each company.
By a symmetric argument, we have that :
$$
V_{B}=(1-s_{AA})\sum_{t=0}^{\infty}\pi_{tA}+(1-s_{AB})\sum_{t=0}^{\infty}\pi_{tB}
$$"

811,Why doesn't the ECB implement the same fiscal and monetary policy that the FED used to save the US economy?,"The ECB faces a unique challenge in that the Eurozone is a monetary union without a fiscal union. Because each country has autonomy over their own fiscal policy and there is no separate Eurobond, it is unclear which countries' bonds the ECB would buy to perform Quantitative Easing. In the US this is easy because of the presence of US Treasury Bonds that  the Federal Reserve can readily purchase. "
812,How to deal with a singular Leontiev inverted matrix?,"I am not sure exactly what you divided by what, but suppose your input-output table looks like this:
$$
A = 
\left[
\begin{array}{lll}
a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\
a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33}
\end{array}
\right]
$$
If you proceed to divide the first column by $\sum\limits_i a_{i,1}$ the second by $\sum\limits_i a_{i,2}$ and the third by $\sum\limits_i a_{i,3}$ then your new matrix will have 1 as an eigenvalue. (You can show this by showing that the norm of any vector is unchanging upon multiplication with the matrix by straightforward calculation.) This is problematic, because if $s$ is an eigenvector then
$$
A \cdot s = s = I \cdot s 
$$
which implies
$$
(I - A) \cdot s = 0
$$
which in turn implies that $I - A$ is not invertible (singular). So my guess would be that the problem is the division."
813,Differences between Hicksian and Slutskian approaches,"The income effect (IE) is about assessing purchasing-power impacts of a price change, while the substitution effect (SE) is about the impact of that price change on the relative attractiveness of the different goods. In reality these effects are not observable - when a price changes, your consumption choices will change for both reasons. But we can conceptually decompose the overall effect into IE/SE. In the SE we will be looking to isolate the impact of relative prices changing, without the purchasing-power effect."
814,Is there any article or paper that describes what Thomas Sargent thinks of New Keynesian economics/models?,"This journal article (Oct 29-2011,) has parts from a telephone conversation of the journalist with Sargent:"
815,Saturation of durable goods,"""Durable goods"" are a form of utility-generating capital. But they are capital, and what is actually generating utility is the flow of services from them, not them directly. So when we buy a durable good, this is not consumption, it is investment. The phenomenon of uneven intertemporal allocation of purchasing expenses in durable goods is not related to ""saturation"", in the sense the word is used in microeconomic theory: saturation and non-saturation is a static concept. Intertemporally, the capital stock may very well decline, as an optimal choice : we pile up capital early on, and then, the rate of usage is greater than the rate of further accumulation: we use what we have bought in the past, wearing down the stock.

821,How does the money supply behave when bank loans are repaid?,"The money is removed when the loan principal is repaid. The actual point in the loan this occurs depends on the loan terms. For a typical compound interest rate loan, this means a small portion of the principal is repaid every month, and a matching liability deposit (money in the customers account) is removed."

Procurement prices of agricultural produce, what the government payed to farmers, were lower than consumer prices of the same produce, what the government got from selling the produce to the consumers. The difference in prices becomes state revenue. The widening of the gap between the two prices is likened to the opening of a pair of scissors, hence the name. "
826,"Can integrals be interpreted simultaneously as aggregates and averages? (Mas-Colell et al. 1995, Proposition 4.C.4)",I talked to my teacher to try and get a handle on the question.
827,How to determine the price a monopolist will set when the demand curve the firm faces isn't known?,"The monopolist is allowed to set the price. However, because his product has a perfect substitute, he can sell 0 products at prices $p>2$. He also has no incentive seting the price $p<2$, because the consumers will buy any number of products he wishes to sell at $p = 2$. This means that $p(q) = 2$. Its graph in the $(q,p)$ coordinate system would be a horizontal line at $p = 2$. Because of this, $p'(q) = 0$. Correcting for this you should be able to easily finish the exercise. "

I think this would be a lot simpler than what you are currently doing."
837,How much do real-estate prices correlate with apartment rental prices?,"In theory there should be a direct positive correlation (especially in countries where house prices are a part of the index which is used to define rental rates), but in reality there is a lot of variation in the results for this question depending on the country, possible effects of different laws, the business cycle, whether new housing is being built or not, etc."
838,Hausman Test for Simultaneous Equations,"Generally, price is endogenous in this set of simultaneous equations.  One strategy we can use to overcome the bias is to find a valid instrument for price—call it $Z$.  We’d need something that satisfies $Cov(P, Z) \neq 0$ and $Cov(Z, \mu_1) = 0$."

They even include interviews with economists such as Robert Lucas Jr. and Milton Friedman to mention a few.

There is no methodological criteria that unified the Chicago school and separates it from the rest of economics. I think this is true even for Friedman, whose methodological paper you refer to. If you look at his macroeconomic work such as his Monetary History of the United States, Theory of the Consumption Function or his famous presidential address to the AEA,there is nothing in it which is different from the methodology of mainstream economics.

880,Does it matter if your decision might not matter?,"Interesting question. I don't have any empirical evidence to offer, so I can't answer your question if that's what you're asking for."
881,Uncovered interest parity and asymmetric capital controls,"In principle it shouldn't really matter that a sub-population (in this case the locals) have capital restrictions, so long as the unrestricted population is sufficiently large.  The UIP model only needs that the capital can flow - it doesn't mind who is doing it."
882,How might the Swiss currency floor be unwound?,"Central banks have a lot of leeway from a balance sheet perspective to do these things. They can simply stop the practice of buying foreign currency when the CHF appreciates which would let it appreciate beyond 1.2. If it keeps appreciating they will book losses, but unless they are enormous, these typically don't make a dent in a central bank's balance sheet."

884,Indifference curves and equivalence classes,"Yes, indifference is an equivalent relation."
885,What type of graph can be hepful to explain the type of errors that should be used?,"You are saying: $y$ is regressed on $x_1$ and $x_2$, say, and you think it would be better to use cluster errors since you expect $y$ is correlated with abilities for each person."
886,How do I begin to approach this dynamic discrete choice model?,"$b_t$ is the decision variable, and the value function is formulated as a function of the state variable of the problem. In your case, the role of the state variable is played by the $p$ parameter, which may change in each period (updated). So your Bellman equation is"
887,Does the envelope theorem hold at a corner solution?,"First, you made a sign error in the computations. After correcting for your error, a crucial hypothesis you miss is that $X$, the choice set, does not depend on the variable $t$ in the theorem (with the notations of the theorem). To apply the theorem properly, the interval $[0,L]$ should not depend on $L$."

892,How to specify a Diff-In-Diff Regression with multiple time periods?,"I am a bit confused because you said there are two treatments. I presume that one ""treatment"" group is the control group and the other is the treatment group. (I don't think you have a separate control group.) I am also confused because you said the treatment is identical until round 3 but then the treatment begins in round 2. I presume that there is no treatment in rounds 1 and 2, and the treatment group is treated differently thereafter in rounds 3, 4 and 5."
893,Where do computational economists work,The most useful way of thinking of a Computational Economist is one that will be able to estimate economic models in a quantitatively meaningful way. This makes them very useful for central banks which have the need to study the macroeconomy quantitatively and also have the time and resources to invest in a computational economist...

899,What does Varoufakis mean by 'banks can make up money' in 'Talking to my daughter about the economy'?,"Banks and the finance industry have an essential function of allocating capital to productive uses, intermediating between savers and investors, and managing risk. However, banking deregulation, beginning in the 1970s (and not ""centuries ago"" as claimed by Varoufakis), has moved this industry toward rent-seeking activities. So, since then, bankers do not lend money from savings accounts deposits. This is ""the legend"". They offer financial services. They are engaged in lending by trading bonds and securities. They are engaged in futures markets (central financial exchanges where standardized futures contracts are traded - see wikipedia)."

You then combine these two optimality conditions to yield (7)."

It includes use of panel data (cross sectional data that you are interested in can be considered a special case of panel data) to study the effects of the minimum wage on employment."
912,Comparative Methods of Econometric Analysis,"In econometrics and statistics, you sometimes will truncate outliers. Otherwise, maybe it's worth mentioning that in the business of predicting, analysts are punished for either being wrong, but their punished even more if they were boldly wrong. This is a form of herding behavior. Deviating from the consensus can be disproportionately risky."
913,Labour markets and supply-side policies: too much stress put on the WS push factors?,"I think it depends on the category of literature you're reading. The category of innovation literature has a lot about supply-side cost changes, and about related policies - you'll find lots of work on learning curves, technology diffusion, harnessing economies of scale. Frank Geels of Manchester does a lot of work on the theoretical side of this."

In 1834 it was absolutely true that you could walk up to a bank and demand one ounce of gold or in some time periods silver for \$20.67.  Of course, you would have to accumulate \$20.67 which was a lot of money.  The Treasury would demand upon receipt of a banknote any and all gold represented by those notes at all times during this period."

916,In microeconomics : is this the contradiction in the atomicity of firms ?,"This does sound a lot like the “contradiction” that Keen tries to derive. The key to resolving it is to remember that firms are small relative to the market, so $$\frac{\mathrm dQ}{\mathrm dq_i} = 0.$$"
917,"If Greece defaults, can it still stay with the euro?","The Greek banks will not be able to get any Euro to give out, if the IMF and the EU cuts of all the loans to Greece.   Therefore if Greeces remains in the Euro, there will be no banking system in Greece."

919,Can someone explain graphically why MRS is invariant under monotonic transformation?,You're right that it's a bit counterintuitive that the shape of the indifference curves shouldn't change when you transform the utility function. The reason is that you are transforming along an axis that is perpendicular to the plane where the indifference curve lives.
920,"Why (neoclassical) economic models have no profits, unlike the real world?","Accounting (after tax) profits are net of depreciation and of interest paid on loans, or of any capital/equipment actually rented by the firm. So conceptually, they map to ""net returns on own capital"".  "
921,Why is elasticity not defined simply as the slope of the graph?,"A key feature of elasticity is that it is a unit-free measure.  Suppose we are considering the price-elasticity of demand for apples which is $\frac{{\triangle}y/y}{{\triangle}x/x}$ where $y$ is quantity demanded and $x$ is price.  The elasticity will be the same whether apples are measured in pounds (lb) or kilograms (kg) because both $\triangle y$ and $y$ will be in the same units.  Similarly it will not matter in which currency price is measured, because $\triangle x$ and $x$ will be in the same currency units.  This makes comparisons of elasticities, between goods measured in different units, or between countries with different currencies, much more meaningful than comparisons of slopes.  "
922,Why are firms taken to be profit-maximizing? Shouldn't that make them risk-neutral?,Why would a [risk-neutral] firm need to diversify if all it wanted to do was maximise profit?
923,Why do so many models assume homothetic preferences?,"Here a short answer: Homothetic, identical preferences have the modelling advantage that the distribution of income across individuals does not matter for aggregate demand. That is, if you want to study, let's say, monetary policy where you do not expect changes in the distribution of income to affect your policy recommendations, then this is a reasonable assumption to make. If you want to study questions where changes in the distribution of income have large impact on policy recommendation (e.g., optimal taxation) this may be a bad assumption."
924,Why do central banks currently favor cheap money policies?,"Most central banks' primary goal is maintaining a moderate inflation (around 2 %). In some cases, they also have a secondary and lesser mandate to care for employment numbers."
925,What does a stock market index stand for?,Indexes don't have units. They're indexes.
926,Why should Greece destroy their cash euros?,Using Google translate I have read some of the articles you referred. It seems to me that the problem the Swedish economists are talking about is that Greece will need its own currency (this is debatable). However it takes a long time to get currency in sufficient amounts.
927,What is virtual valuation?,"Suppose you face a single buyer whose willingness to pay, $v$, is distributed according to $F(v)$. If you charge a price $p$, he will buy if and only if $v>p$, leaving you with expected revenue of $$r(p)=\Pr(v>p)p=[1-F(p)]p.$$"
928,What is the difference between present value and face value?,Suppose the face value of a bond is $M$ and its interest rate is $\tau$. This means it will pay $\tau \cdot M$ interest every year (other periods are also possible) and at the end of its run (its maturity) it will also repay the face value $M$. Government bonds are usually sold in auctions. Whatever ends up being the market price is considered to be the present value of the bond. Using the cash flow you can also calculate the yield of the bond. If and only if the face value and the present value are equal the yield will be equal to the interest rate.
929,Is ongoing economic growth possible without additional non-renewable inputs?,"This would fall under the category of endogenous growth models. As dismalscience pointed out innovation is one source of growth, however it is important to distinguish between innovation and technological change. Innovation is sometimes confused with technological change, which is an exogenous process, but is more often associated with endogenous growth."
930,Is a mixed strategy ever the best response to a pure strategy?,"Fixing the strategy of the opponent, a mixed strategy never yields a strictly higher utility if you are expected utility-maximizing.
The reason is that the expected utility from a mixed strategy is at most as high as the highest utility from the pure strategies which this mixed strategy plays with positive probability.
That is not to say that a mixed strategy cannot be a best response, though. 
Consider for example rock-paper-scissors and a imagine your opponent playing each of the three actions with equal probability.
This leaves you indifferent between all three actions and hence any mixed strategy is a best response."
931,What is the exact relationship between the efficient-market and random-walk hypotheses?,I just want to build on @Alecos's nice answer. I'll restate some of what he said and add a few other details.
932,What does Hayek mean at the end of the first paragraph of The Use of Knowledge?,"Your marginal rate of substitution between (say) eggs and wine is the number of eggs you'd be willing to trade for one additional bottle of wine.  This marginal rate of substitution can reflect your preferences (if you're a consumer) or the state of technology (if you're a producer who can, for example, substitute three eggs for one wine in your production process)."
933,Is the Convex Combination of Two Pareto Optimal Allocations Also Pareto Optimal?,"Here 
$$\not\exists\;x_i^\star\; s.t.\; u_i(\alpha x_i)\geq u_i(\alpha x_i^\star)\;\forall i\;\text{and}\;u_i((1-\alpha)\hat{x}_i)\geq u_i((1-\alpha)x_i^\star)$$
$$\implies\not\exists\;x_i^\star\;s.t.\;u_i(\alpha x_i^\star+(1-\alpha)x_i^\star)\geq u_i(\alpha x_i+(1-\alpha)\hat{x}_i)$$
you assume that the function $u$ is linear. Unfortunately the statement is false for non-linear utility functions. Try 
$$
U_1(x_1,y_1) = x_1 \cdot y_1^2 \hskip 20pt U_2(x_2,y_2) = x_2^2 \cdot y_2.
$$
Given 1 unit of $x$ and $y$ each, the allocations
$$
(x_1,y_1) = (1,1) \hskip 20pt (x_2,y_2) = (0,0)
$$
and
$$
(x_1',y_1') = (0,0) \hskip 20pt (x_2',y_2') = (1,1)
$$
are both Pareto-optimal. However the points on the connecting $x = y$ line are not. You can verify this by comparing $MRS_1$ and $MRS_2$ for points on the line. Hence the Pareto-set is not convex in this case. (It is a curve connecting the two extreme allocations given above.)"
934,Why do we use tax brackets?,I think you've misunderstood how the (UK) income tax brackets work. They work differently to how stamp duty used to work.
935,Why is the Euro a bad idea compared to other currencies?,"One of the key requirements for a currency area to be successful is that there must be a sustainable political mandate to support fiscal transfers between regions, to provide the balancing mechanism that would otherwise have been performed by fluctuating currency rates between those regions."
936,Is money capital?,"""...capitalists buy and sell money as though it were a productive

937,Are stock exchanges market makers?,"No, they are not market makers."
938,Why not say the buyer will *definitely* buy at price X?,"Under Yatharth's approach, the set of prices at which Bob will definitely buy an apple is the closed interval $[\$0,\$1]$, which is nice. However, the set of prices at which Bob will definitely not buy an apple now becomes an open interval $(\$1,\infty]$."

945,What would you call a real market that is close to perfect competition?,I don't think there is a standard term for what you'd want to refer to. I'd consider the following good candidates though: 
946,"If Germany is the largest exporter, why do Chinese products pervade the the US market?","Intermediate and capital goods used in the production of other goods are often very expensive and made by Germany. Think fancy manufacturing equipment in chemicals, semiconductors, and metal fabrication as well as precisely manufactured consumables like processed chemicals and auto-parts. Chinese goods are ubiquitous because they are skewed towards final goods like toys and white goods we consume at in our homes. "
947,What actually went wrong in the economy as described by “The Big Short”?,The problem at the bottom of the 2008 crash is that the values of multiple instruments were dramatically over estimated because the risk of default in the various underlyings was dramatically underestimated since it was assumed that they were fully backed by the US government.
948,Two variables: Which moves first?,"""Who moves first"" can be conveniently detached from any causal inference, since there may be some third variable influencing both. Certainly one could build a logical and reasonable argument that links increases in investment to increases in GDP (or vice versa), but it is not necessary.  "

951,What does it mean to make an identification assumption?,"Identifying assumption: assumptions made about the DGP that allows you to draw causal inference. E.g. exogeneity assumption for IV, parallel trends assumption in diff-in-diff."
952,What Creates the Price in the First Place,"This is indeed a bit confusing. Supply and demand functions depend on potential prices. That is, the agents think ""if the price were a given level, what would I want to supply or demand?"". So supply and demand depend on a whole range of (hypothetical) prices. However, the equilibrium price (which is a certain price and different from the range of potential prices) is that price where both supply and demand meet. In your example, the equilibrium is where the circular logic stops and finds a resting point, which is also why we refer to it as an equilibrium. This is a concept, which we borrowed from physics and is often used to mean a position where things stop changing/moving."
953,Is a strong foundation in advanced microeconomic theory essential to study environmental economics at the graduate level?,It depends on what you like to do in environmental economics. There are lots of people who are working on moral hazard issues on environmental economics by principal-agent models. 
954,Why are we taking the logarithm for risk-averse decision-makers?,"Let's step back. In general, utility functions are (monotone increasing) functions $f(w)$ that map wealth into utility. That is, the input $w$ is money and the output $f(w)$ is utility. If we have a distribution $\vec{p}$ over possible wealth outcomes $w$, then my expected utility is $\mathbb{E}f(w) = \sum_i p_i f(w_i)$."
955,Examples of non-differentiable problems in economics,Here are four I could think of:
956,"“Buy a country”, expression or possibility?","What do you mean? A country per se cannot be bought. The wealthiest man, Gates, has a net worth of around 67 billion USD (forbes). What could he buy?"

959,Are state owned enterprises really inefficient?,"Because of the large number of roughly comparably sized private and public firms, the petroleum industry provides a laboratory for exploring differences between private and state owned enterprises in related businesses. Without passing judgement on if it has to be that way,  it appears as though the private firms are vastly more efficient:"
960,Collusion model with imperfect public monitoring,"You'll get different answers depending on assumptions, so the answer is maybe. Two papers come to mind."

963,How is the GDP growing when nothing else seems to be?,There's a bit to unpack here.
964,Completeness of Preferences,"The first key to understanding this is to recognise that consumers have preferences not over goods, but over states of the world. A ""state"" is a complete description of all factors that are relevant to a decision."
965,Why is everyone suggested to specialize their education?,"Note: I did not vote down on this question, and it is not clear why anyone would do so."
966,Independence axiom of lottery when $\alpha \ge 1$,"To understand why $\alpha$ must be constrained in $(0,1)$, one has to contemplate the meaning of the expression"
967,Could markets compute equilibria?,"Computing an equilibrium is not needed for implementing it. This was the mistake of Lange and co. and was decisively rebutted by Hayek.
If you want a mathematical formulation, simply take a tatonement process. Given prices, each individual needs to compute her net demand correspondence. Under different tatonement mechanisms, which are an idealization of the dynamic process of price adjustment in the real-world economy, prices should converge to approximate equilibria. In both experimental settings and in financial markets, there is ample evidence for convergence. "
968,Limits to Growth: Is environmental collapse by 2030 a likely scenerio?,We know one core element of the Guardian article is nonsense - the discussion of Peak Oil.
969,Kuhn Tucker Conditions with fewer non-negativity constraints than number of variables,"Non-negativity constraints have nothing special and are not critical for the general validity of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker approach. First, realize that we could have $x \geq a >0$ and then we could write $x-a \geq 0$ and view this ""non-negativity"" constraint as just one more inequality constraint on the solution."
970,intertemporal utility function usage : calculating consumption,"Now that the OP has provided his own answer, let's also give the standard treatment of this problem.  "

973,Usage of natural gas in 1970 (where was the demand elasticity?),"tl;dr: it's basic engineering: efficiencies improved between 1970 and 2010. Additionally, net USA imports increased from 0.75 trillion cubic feet in 1970 to 3.8 trillion cubic feet in 2007"

978,What is an economic crisis?,"I don’t think crisis itself has set definition as opposed to recession, unless you attach some clarifier to it as the examples you mention. Generally the word is even in academic work thrown around quite loosely."
979,"Was the average person no better off in 1800 than in 100,000 BC?","In a detailed review of Clark's book, concluding that its ""central theses ... are contradicted by well-known evidence"" (p 969), Robert Allen addresses the claim about 1800 and 100,000 BC in a section headed ""Malthus in the Very Long Run"" (pp 951-5). His criticisms of Clark include:"
980,How can there be an electronic bank run?,"What you describe is the ""traditional"" bank-run.  "
981,What is the economic interpretation of this utility function?,This looks like constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) utility . Usually CRRA is written like $U = \frac{C^{1-\rho}-1}{1-\rho}  $ (I omitted second part for brevity) in your case $a=1-\rho$. $\rho$ is the relative risk aversion. By extension $a$ is the function of $\rho$ so as $a$ increases (due to smaller $\rho$) the person should become less risk averse. 
982,Is there a name for this generalization of the stable marriage problem?,"Yes, this has been studied. Look up ""matching with contracts"" and the earlier papers by Crawford & Knoer (1981), and Kelso & Crawford (1982) in Econometrica. "
983,Use of Slutsky equation,"Utility function $u(x_1, x_2) = x_1^2x_2$."
984,Is belief in future dividends the only long term value of stock?,"A stock is a claim on the profit of a company, along with the voting power to control that company and force it to pay out when you want it to.  The value of every stock is defined by the payments (from the profit of the firm) the holder expects to get at some point.  If the stock pays no dividends, it is because the stockholders have allowed management to plow that profit back into the firm in hopes of greater dividends down the line."
985,What is a homothetic function?,"If a utility function is homothethic,
$-\frac {\frac {\partial u}{\partial x} (tx)} {\frac {\partial u} {\partial y} (ty)} = -\frac {\frac {\partial u}{\partial x} (x)} {\frac {\partial u} {\partial y} (y)} $"
986,Which think-tanks on economics do you use to keep up with the news?,"I like also shorter columns, which are based on good academic papers. So, the VOX, CEPR's policy portal is very good. They occasionally take unsolicited columns, but many are based on CEPR or NBER working papers."
987,"given someone's past investing history, is there a way to calculate his risk aversion?",Generally speaking no. You wouldn't be able to distinguish re-balancing for risk aversion reasons from re-balancing motivated by changes in expected returns or the co-variance of returns. 
988,Difference between Sequential and Weak Sequential (Weak Perfect Bayesian) Equilibria?,Let's review the definitions of the two concepts. Let $\sigma$ be a profile of strategies and $\mu$ a system of beliefs.
989,Taylor Rule: Relationship between interest rate and inflation,"It's true that in response to an oil shock, the Taylor rule could recommend increasing the interest rate to reduce inflation. In practice it would mean that as interest increases, consumption falls. This could be from less credit financed spending, or because the opportunity cost of holding money has increased, therefore people invest more in illiquid assets (bonds in an IS-LM context) and therefore consume less. As consumption falls, aggregate demand falls, therefore putting pressure off prices causing a reduction in inflation."
990,When is a utility representation differentiable?,"A continuous, transitive, complete, convex, and locally non-satiated preference on an open convex subset $V$ of some $\mathbb{R}^l$ has an $r$-times continuously differentiable utility representation with no critical points if and only if the space $I=\{(x,y)\in V\times V\mid x\sim y\}$ is a $C^r$-manifold."
991,What were the factors that caused the Philips curve to stop working during the 1970s?,"The general way people figured the Phillips curve worked was that a shock in aggregate demand or fiscal stimulus would cause labor demand to increase as government spending generated growth, which makes labor more scarce and causes firms to compete for workers by raising nominal wages. Wage costs then rise, and the firm passes on some of the cost to the consumer by raising the prices of their products."
992,Why are stock prices so time sensitive?,"While the prices of equities do fluctuate in response to information about the underlying enterprises, this is not the first order or likely even second order reason why they do so. "
993,Do general equilibrium models include money?,"While many general equilibrium models do not need to model money to approach the questions that they would like to answer, there are many models that do include money to address questions that need money to be a relevant feature of the model. These models do it in a variety of ways -- some might be more relevant than others. I will try and describe two of the approaches briefly."
994,Are there two different meanings of the discount rate?,"It is standard approach by now to acknowledge the existence of a ""rate of pure time preference"", denoted usually by $\rho$, that characterizes individuals. This is a fundamental aspect of preferences - a ""primitive"" parameter. It is not a proxy for the existence of uncertainty (this is why it is found also in deterministic models), neither does it reflect ""economic opportunity costs"" (this is why it discounts future utility also).

Hayashi goes some length into writing out explicitly large matrices, which is virtually with no-precedent (see eg. pages 267, or 288), something that eventually facilitates understanding -as long as you don't back out from a matrix half a page large, but you really look at it."

1004,Why use marginal rather than average tax rates in incentive analysis?,"People make decisions based on how the decision will change things.  If I work an extra \$1000 worth of time, then I have to pay $\$1000 * \text{marginal tax rate}$ in taxes.  The average rate is irrelevant to that calculation.  It's a little more complicated than that in that the marginal tax rate may change over that \$1000.  "
1005,How would gross world product look like if fossil fuel is treated as capital and not as income?,"There is a large literature considering the depletion of natural resources, including fossil fuels, in relation to GDP. Some writers explicitly refer to such resources as a kind of natural capital. Others may refer to natural resource assets, or simply to natural resources. A key question within this literature is whether depletion of natural resources should be recognised via a deduction within net domestic product (NDP), in (broadly) the same way that a deduction is made for depreciation of man-made capital.  The range of views is wide. Some examples: "

1011,Is there an economically sound way to decide between buying media or a streaming subscription?,"Partly your question relates to more general questions like ""buy versus rent a house"", or ""buy versus lease a machine"". Under neoclassical assumptions of  competition, full information, etc, you can imagine that arbitrage would make these options equivalent for the average of the population (or the representative agent). In practice, heterogeneous individuals might prefer one option than the other."
1012,How are ties broken in a second price sealed bid auction?,"The winner pays the second highest bid, which is 5 dollars, however who the winner is depends on the tie-breaking rule. There are multiple rules one could use. In most cases it is assumed that the winner is selected randomly from among the people who placed the highest bids. But you could also select the winner from this group alphabetically or by checking who submitted their bid first."
1013,What is the Economic Rationale for Discounted Early-Bird Parking?,"There seems to be some research on price discounting. For example, this paper studies two forms of dicounting, last-minute discounting and early-bird discounting, in settings with monopoly, duopoly and competitive markets. They propose a model and run some experiments. Some excerpts from this paper:"
1014,"If the (direct) utility is concave in all goods, is the indirect utility necessarily concave in wealth?","Your statement does not seem to be true for normal goods either. A counterexample:
$$
U(x_1,x_2) = (x_1x_2)^{\frac{2}{3}}
$$
By the Cobb-Douglas property the optimum bundle given $w,p$ is
$$
(x_1,x_2) = \left(\frac{w}{2p_1}, \frac{w}{2p_2}\right),
$$
so both goods are normal. The indirect utility is
$$
U(w,p) = \left(\frac{1}{4p_1p_2}\right)^{\frac{2}{3}}w^{\frac{4}{3}}.
$$
Here $w$ is raised to a power higher than 1 so $U(w,p)$ is convex in $w$."
1015,Where does capital come from?,"Material capital is any durable good that is used as a factor of production and, by virtue of being durable, it is gradually consumed in production over a maximum possible duration of a length that is determined by (i) how much a unit of capital is used and (ii) the depreciation rate of a unit of capital. Capital forms by labor and savings (which is in accordance with the labor theory of value) and/or capital forms by chance (which is in accordance with the marginal theory of value). "

At the core of is the question Is equity finance expensive?. We certainly observe in the data that the realized returns on firm debt are much lower than the realized returns on firm equity. Does this mean that firms have too much equity?"

1025,Bayes-Nash equilibrium and correctness of beliefs,"I think your definition is incorrect, or at least incomplete.** Usually, in a Bayesian game, there is assumed to be a prior distribution on $T$ (where $T = \times_i T_i$). This distribution is called the ""common prior"" and it is assumed to be common knowledge that types are drawn according to this distribution. In this case, each player $i$'s belief $p_i$ is given by Bayesian updating on $T_i$ and this prior; and in BNE player $i$ must be best-responding to this belief."
1026,"Is fisher equation a definition, identity? Or is it rather a very good estimate","The fisher equation has its basis in the fact that the real return on an asset is the nominal return divided by the inflation rate. If you hold a bond today, it gives you back $1+r_{t+1}$ tomorrow. This is basically $\frac{1+\iota_{t}}{1+\pi_{t+1}}$ such that the promised nominal rate is deflated by the inflation rate. Rearranging terms, you get your definition. This is exact and always holds conceptually. The approximation is that $i\approx r+\pi$  which is obtained via a Taylor series expansion."

I'll use the US Federal Reserve's here, viz.

1035,Overview: Crises and their causes,by Charles Kindleberger
1036,What does trade deficit really mean?,"Every country has a trade balance, which is defined as exports minus imports. The United States is a typical observing state, which means their imports are higher than their exports. I do not know the current numbers but USD 1m of imports and USD 600k might be right. In this sense you import USD 400k than you export. 
Now as you already pointed out you have to pay you imports in USD. Now the point NickJ mentioned is insofar important  as to understand what you are actually entitled when holding USD. And all you are entitled to is to buy products within the United States. True, you as a single person could change it into another currency, but this does not change the fact that some else is holding USD and is sooner or later going to demand goods in USD."
1037,What does it mean if a economic model is internally consistent?,In theoretical modeling the consistency is applied in the same way as in philosophy/logic. Internal consistency simply means that the argument is consistent with itself and has no contradiction within itself (as opposed to external consistency where its not enough for argument to be valid on its own but it should also not contradict other facts). 
1038,"Conditional probability in Kaplan, Menzio (2014)",The first / second seller terminology can be confusing here (does it relate to time or to conditionality?). It's safer to focus on a particular seller.
1039,Example of Law of One Price holds but No Arbitrage Fails,Examples where this happens are always extreme and contrived. I can think of two kinds of examples. The first is where you have an asset that for some reason has a price of zero or negative but a positive payoff in some states (perhaps no other asset pays off in that state). The second is where you have two assets with positive prices that have negative payoffs in all states (or vice versa).
1040,Why was Swiss National Bank in red by keeping fix exchange rate to Euro?,"From a central bank's point of view, printing money isn't free.  Each 1 CHF created costs exactly 1 CHF - that is, it appears on the bank's balance sheet as a liability.  They owe that 1 CHF to someone (the person they bought the Euros off - a bank).  And whenever you owe someone money, there is always the ultimate belief that you can pay it back.  Lose that and the bank fails, and the currency fails."
1041,Who first used the term “externality” in economics?,"I suspect you have found the author responsible for the original coinage of the word ""externality"" within economics, with this meaning."
1042,Dealing with Missing Data when Testing the CAPM,"Easiest fix: if you're worried about it you should value weight your results. This is suggest by, for instance, Kothari, Shanken and Sloan (1995). Firms that are delisted tend to have extremely small market cap, so value weighting gives them very little impact on summary statistics. Delisted returns should also be used, although I'm not sure how much impact they'll have. I've seen the delisted return stuck into the month after a stock ceases to be traded."
1043,Convergence in probability and convergence in distribution,"I will attempt to explain the distinction using the simplest example: the sample mean. Suppose we have an iid sample of random variables $\{X_i\}_{i=1}^n$. Then define the sample mean as $\bar{X}_n$. As the sample size grows, our value of the sample mean changes, hence the subscript $n$ to emphasize that our sample mean depends on the sample size. "

1047,Are cryptocurrencies a ponzi scheme or a bubble?,"In general, ""Ponzi schemes"" in the context of asset pricing refer to ""rational bubbles"", or a failure of the transversality condition you need when passing from a flow identity to a present value identity. They are not ""fraudulent schemes"". For instance, there can be a rational bubble on a ""fundamentally"" worthless asset in a perfect foresight world if its price grows at the real interest rate available in the broader economy. (This is actually what you're talking about, in case it's not clear to you - each investor assumes they can offload the asset at a higher price to another investor, and you push the problem of the ""greatest fool"" to infinity, which makes the assumption a rational one ex post.)"

1052,What is the difference between a loan and an investment?,"A loan is an agent lending funds to another agent. This money can be used for investment spending, or it can be used for personal consumption expenditures. It can be used to buy fixed assets like real estate, which may or may not be ""investment"" depending on how you use the terminology. In the case of the IMF, the role of the institution is to ensure financial stability by providing funds to countries in an emergency; for example, a country which becomes insolvent and is unable to service its sovereign debt is likely to seek help from the IMF. The IMF would then provide a bailout loan along with a stabilization program aimed at improving the country's public finances. This is not investment, in the sense that it does not grow the country's capital stock; it just allows it to meet its obligations to past creditors."

1062,How are shell companies used for tax evasion?,"Another key feature of those shell companies is that they hide the ultimate beneficiary of the transactions. Banks, insurance companies and most financial services firm must make enquiries as part of the ""Know Your Customer"" (KYC) regulations: they should be able to find out who will benefit ultimately from the transactions, or in the name of whom they are carried out. THeoretically (ate least in the EU), if they fail to identify an ultimate beneficiary, they should refuse to carry out the transaction AND warn the responsible authority (typically the local equivalent or representative of the FATF - Financial Action Task Force)"
1063,Does dollar cost averaging actually have any advantage over one time investment?,The seminal academic criticism of dollar cost averaging on many specifications of economic conditions is A Note on the Suboptimality of Dollar-Cost Averaging as an Investment Policy (Constantinides (1979)).

1064,From Discrete to Continuous time: Total Differential,"You can separate your function in three terms by writing
\begin{align}
& v(c_{t+\Delta},u_{t+\Delta},t+\Delta)-v(c_t,u_t,t) = \\
& v(c_{t+\Delta},u_{t+\Delta},t+\Delta)-v(c_t,u_{t+\Delta},t+\Delta) \\
+ & v(c_{t},u_{t+\Delta},t+\Delta)-v(c_t,u_t,t+\Delta) \\
+ & v(c_t,u_t,t+\Delta)-v(c_t,u_t,t)
\end{align}
When you divide by $\Delta$ and take the limit $\Delta \rightarrow 0$, the first expression converges to $\dfrac{\partial v}{\partial c} \dfrac{dc}{dt}$, the second expression to $\dfrac{\partial v}{\partial u} \dfrac{du}{dt}$, and the third expression to $\dfrac{\partial v}{\partial t}$. Therefore your total derivative equals

1065,A feasible rational payoff that is not an equilibrium payoff in the repeated game,"It is true because of the discounting. If the discount parameter were $\delta = 1$ then players 1 and 2 could alternate playing TL and MR in equilibrium and then reach the average payoff vector $1,1,5$. But if $\delta < 1$ someone will not play along. Suppose the players are supposed to start with TL. Then MR would follow in the next round then, then TL again, and so on. In this case
$$
U_1 = 0 + 2 \cdot \delta + 0 \cdot \delta^2 + 2 \cdot \delta^3 + ...
$$
Yet by always playing B player 1 would achieve the payoff
$$
U_1' = 1 + 1 \cdot \delta + 1 \cdot \delta^2 + 1 \cdot \delta^3 + ...
$$
which is larger then $U_1$. Similarly player 2 would not want to start with MR. So these are not equilibrium playoffs. (Not even Aumann's correlated-equilibrium would do the trick.)"

1089,Does the Lucas (1978) asset pricing model feature complete markets?,"It seems to me that we might as well say that markets are complete. It seems to me to be somewhat inconsequential since this is a representative agent model and that market clearing requires that the only assets that the agent may hold in positive net supply are the $n$ trees. The prices of all Arrow-Debreu securities may be inferred from shadow prices. Suppose the optimization problem is rewritten such that the agent may invest in the $n$ trees plus the set of all Arrow-Debreu securities. (There will be redundancies---I'm hand-waving a little.) The market clearing conditions say that, in equilibrium, the agent must have a unit holding in each of the $n$ trees and zero holdings in the rest of the assets and the price of each of these securities in equilibrium must be set to support these holdings. Since market completeness is a matter of whether or not the agent may trade in all of these securities, we may interpret the situation a two different ways: either the agent can invest in the Arrow-Debreu securities (as well as the trees) but the AD securities must be in zero net supply or the agent cannot invest in the AD securities (only in the trees). In either case, the result is the same."

1097,List of theoretical models of learning,"If you aren't interested in learning from a game and decision theoretic perspective, I'm not exactly sure why you're posting on an economics forum. Because that's what learning really is, from an economics perspective. AI really breaks down into three subfields: logical, behavioral, and machine learning. The logical subfield deals with logical reasoning, automated proof-writing, automated conjecture making, and such. Behavioral AI is really more in line with theoretical economics- game theory, decision theory, mechanism design, etc. "
1098,Do all mixed strategy Nash Equilibria satisfy Trembling Hand perfection?,No. Trembling hand perfection would be an additional consideration.
1099,Understanding Inflation in a video game,"You seem to think of a game where objects are obtained at a fixed rate by farming. Fix supply of work for a certain object (bc. Only a few people know where to find things to farm or are high enough level or have the right profession) and increase demand (new players coming in or more players buying in game currency for real money) then prices for the object will soar over time, people producing the object will find it easier to sell it, so much so that they will increase the price until people stop buying it. This will inflate the price of the object. Whether this will last over longer period of time then depends on many factors : ability of supply to adjust (e.g. How much are player willing to switch to farming that object?), rate of new player characters coming in, their propensity to buy the object etc. "
1100,Incentive compatibility,"First of all, the general form of the problem you got there is extremely demanding. In multidimensional screening problems, analytically often all hell breaks loose in a sense that it is just not tractable. One way out might be this recent approach by Gabriel Carrol: Robustness and Separation in Multidimensional Screening (also provides an introduction that hints at the intractibility of the problem)."
1101,What are the advantages and disadvantages of second price auctions?,"A lot of questions here. Might be helpful to split them into different posts, but let's take a crack at them."
1102,What are main methods for econometrics of Macroeconomics?,"There are many different econometric methods used in macroeconometrics, but the basic ones are advanced versions of least squares methods and Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). Structural VARs, ARCH/GARCH models and several others are widely used as well."
1103,Who exploits comparative advantage in international trade?,"It's fine to make a supposition that it costs Colombia twice as much to make cars as coffee, and Japan twice as much to make coffee as cars.  It's also fine to express these ratios in terms of the respective local currencies.    "
1104,Finding optimal Inflation - Walsh,Edit: Roel Beetsma replied! He says he got the same derivation we basically got. So the solutions seem to be mistaken and we win! Also I'm removing the strikeout below.
1105,Are there any major commodity markets with a public order book?,"Major trading exchanges have order books that anyone can see, if they're willing to pay for the service. So in that sense, they are available to the public. For example, anyone can subscribe via a broker to the London Stock Exchange Level 2 data, which shows them the live order books for listed instruments."
1106,Ok to normalize GDP change by population change?,I guess there might be some purpose to this but generally this is very different than $g-r$ and probably a bad idea. 
1107,When the convexity assumptions fail,"If you are only looking for references, try google scholar: https://scholar.google.be/scholar?start=0&q=economics+%22without+convexity%22&hl=nl&as_sdt=0,43."
1108,Economics: inductive or deductive? Verificationism or falsificationism?,"As regards the induction/deduction division, economics uses both, and they usually start by some induction followed by mathematizing it and then using deduction. "
1109,Data mining in econometric modelling,"The critical points here are the phrases ""it is recommended that..."", and ""using four lags is a norm"". ""Recommended"" and ""norm"" based on what? On a specific prevailing theoretical model, or on past experience with the specific kind of data? If it is the latter, you do not conflict with any economic theory, if you try something different."
1110,US trade outpaces GDP,"The fact that ""trade in the United States seems to have grown substantially faster than production"" could be explained by reduction in trade costs. For instance, a decrease in importing partners' tariffs tends to favor US exports. So, for the same level of production or GDP, US sales will be more export oriented. It works similarly for US imports following a reduction of US tariffs."
1111,What are some famous examples of infant industries that failed?,"Malaysia's Proton cars (if you want a specific example ), but overall the Malaysia Automobile industry failed. Currently, only the locals drive Malaysian cars."

  &= -\xi_t \left(\frac 12 \lambda_t^2 \dd t + \lambda_t \dd z_t\right) + \frac 12 \xi_t \lambda_t^2 \dd t \\
  &= -\xi_t \lambda \dd z_t.
\end{align*}"
1113,Does the Marshallian demand function always include prices and income?,"These are proper Marshallian demand functions, even though Income does not appear in them. This is due to specific form of the utility function (and the candidate solution of all goods being purchased at strictly positive quantities). It emerges that there is no income effect for goods $x_1$ and $x_2$ - optimal uncompensated demand does not depend after all on the level of income, but only on the relative prices.  "
1114,Housing Supply Elasticity: Proxy for Exogenous House Price Movements,"The idea is that all else equal, areas with inelastic housing supply (e.g., areas that are surrounded by water, so you can't just build some more houses ""over that way"") will see greater house price growth, which increases household wealth, and that these differences in supply elasticity are exogenous and uncorrelated with other things that matter. In Saiz (2010), he uses terrain and water data to determine the degree to which the housing supply in different metropolitan areas is constrained by geographic features."
1115,"In a hyper-inflated economy, how do vendors know how much to raise their prices?","It's anecdote, but in this fantastic Planet Money piece on breaking Brazil's hyperinflation, there's a pretty good description of how in Brazil, shopkeepers would raise their prices multiple times a day. The strategies described (starting around the 10:00 mark, after the description of people running ahead of the guys with the price guns to buy things before they could raise the prices) include:"
1116,Why shutdown the banks (Greece)?,The deposits that people have in the banks is a lot more than the money that the banks actually have.  This is due to fractional reserve banking.
1117,Evidence that open source production processes increase efficiency and/or consumer surplus?,"There is a large economic literature on intellectual property rights. However, the issue seems far from settled on what even the optimal duration for patents are. Note that open source is even a step further than a 0 day patent duration. A strong case for your view would probably be found in Boldrin/Levine:

1118,Is the contract curve orthogonal to the priceline?,You write that the slope of one line is px/py and of another is -px/py. Take a piece of paper and draw the line y=2x and y=-2x are they orthogonal (answer: no)? In particular case the lines y=x and y=-x are orthogonal.
1119,heteroskedasticity variance estimator bias direction,"I think the problem is that you are mixing up terminology. The statment about an estimator being BLUE states given the Gauss-Markov assumption, OLS is the best linear unbiased estimator. But as your model is heteroskedastic the Gauss-Markov assumptions no longer hold and the proof of OLS being BLUE is no longer true. "
1120,Recovering from large government debt without currency devaluation,"By one estimate (here is another) , as a result of WWII, the United Kingdom saw a debt of more than 200 percent of GDP. They never defaulted on their debt after reaching that level. I believe they never did anything radical, just systematically growing government spending more slowly than national income, thus gradually eroding the debt as a fraction of GDP. "
1121,Normalizing comparisons of corporations and countries,"GDP is a flow (of goods and services) while market capitalization is a stock measure. So I agree, this is not a great comparison. If we want to compare stocks, we'd compare total enterprise value (sum of equity and debt) to national domestic assets. But that's imperfect because much of what makes a country rich is labor income and that's not going to be in domestic assets. So we'd like to add in some measure of human capital. That's going to be imperfect at best. So I prefer to compare flows. "
1122,One-shot deviation principle for infinite repeated games and dynamic programming,A deviation (one-shot or not) can certainly generate a sequence that differs from the optimal one for an arbitrary number of periods. 
1123,Unlimited supply of national currency?,"When a country, or perhaps a country's central bank, prints money it is increasing the money supply. When the amount of money available in an economy increases, the value of the currency will decrease. So think about the capital flight from the Euro to the Kroner that is causing the value of that currency to spike. Printing money can basically cause a 'reversal' of sorts. That is, it places downward pressure on the value of the currency. "
1124,What is the significance of the Hansen-Jagannathan bound?,"Fundamental theorem of asset pricing tells us that if there is no arbitrage, there must exist a positive random variable $M$ (also called stochastic discount factor) such that for any return $R$, we must have $1 = E[M R]$. Thus to understand asset prices, in cross-section as well as across time, we need to understand which factors affect $M$. "
1125,Converting word definitions of Pareto-Optimal into math symbols,Let $\Omega$ be the set of all feasible allocations with an element $\omega \in \Omega$.  Consider $I$ agents such that the utility of agent $i$ is described by $u_i(\omega)$.
1126,What impact did monetary policy actions taken during the Great Recession (2007-09) have on U.S. economic performance?,The consensus appears to be that the effect was large and positive. The IGM Forum asked a panel of economists to assess the statement
1127,Are newspaper articles more liberal than their readership?,"This strikes me as a straightforward industrial organization anomaly question. Like, why do hot dogs and buns come in different counts to a package or why are the finest apples shipped out of apple producing regions?"
1128,What are the effects of the increase/decrease in stock options after an IPO?,"Exactly.  The main issue is if they want to raise capital a second time. The secondary market does not affect the company itself, but it affects its investors. And as investors are important, they need to be treated well.  Another problem related to this is that several employees in the company have stock options, so it really affects them."
1129,Price Elasticity of Demand for Positive Price Increases,"Except of the purely descriptive aspect, ""elastic demand"", or more accurately, regions of the demand schedule where demand elasticity with respect to price is higher than unity, in absolute terms, is linked to the basic monopoly theory, since the monopolist maximizes profits at a point of the demand schedule where ""demand is elastic""."
1130,Portfolio choice of a risk lover,"Since we are suspecting a corner-solution, it is better to write the problem explicitly with its constraint. Even better, use the Fritz John (FJ) conditions rather than the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) ones. We will mention the differences as we go along.  "
1131,Is there a name for this family of games (Binomial games?)?,"OK,  Erel Segal Halevi's comments have placed me on the right track for finding what I was looking for;"
1132,Oligopolistic producers and retail price wars,"A producer won't always want the retail outlets to compete on price. This is the reason for minimum resale price maintenance. By competing on price, it may be that the retailers competition amounts to something closer to a zero-sum game. Supposing there are some consumers who value something like service, it might be better for joint profits to provide good service and thus bring in new consumers. You might imagine two stores selling electronics. The stores might find it best to cut price to pull the customers away from the other. The producer would rather there be good service, display models, helpful employees, etc to bring in new customers."
1133,Inflation reasons beyond Friedman,The US had emitted lots of money and has very little inflation.
1134,"The Backward Bending Supply Curve, Asymmetric Information, and Monopoly","This definitely is not a complete answer. But I can imagine the case of increasing returns to scale. Or natural entry barrier. Increasing returns to scale is often discussed in international trade theory, but it can be also relevant here."
1135,Can we see the computer age in the productivity statistics?,"It means that computers (or IT in general) contribute to the society (they make us better off and more productive at work), but this does not show up in GDP statistics. The reason is that many of these services are for free. As an example, the value of the Google Search is not reflected in a market price for running this search. The problem is related to the societal value of mothers raising their children at home. Other examples are environmental protection or caring for your parents. Since these services are not traded on markets, it does not enter GDP. Whether the Solow quote is actually true is however debatable. The value of the google search engine is to some extent reflected in the advertisement google is selling. And this enters GDP statistics. The relation with the productivity puzzle is whether productivity is actually falling or whether we need new concepts to measure productivity in the computer age."
1136,Deriving a demand curve from a Cobb-Douglas utility,"If you take the general class of CES utility functions, of which Cobb-Douglas is a special case, you do indeed get a demand function that depends on other prices. Specifically, the CES utility function (over $n$ goods, $x_1,\dots,x_n$) takes the form 
\begin{equation}
  u(x_1,\dots,x_n)=\bigl[\alpha_1x_1^\rho+\cdots+\alpha_nx_n^\rho\bigr]^{1/\rho},
\end{equation}
where $\rho\in(-\infty,1]\setminus\{0\}$, $\alpha_i\in[0,1]$ and $\sum_i\alpha_i=1$. We interpret $\alpha_i$ as the consumption share of good $i$ and $\sigma\equiv\frac{1}{1-\rho}$ as the constant elasticity of substitution. Note also that when $\sigma=1$ (or $\rho\to0$), we get the Cobb-Douglas utility form. "
1137,"How are economic principles applied to non-financial models, such as a democratic election?",Long story short: Preferences orderings are over more abstract outcomes instead of money. It's still a story of maximizing expected utility.

1145,Why is the Marginal Utility of losses deminishing in Prospect Theory?,The value function used in Kahneman's prospect theory (which your plot shows) is supposed to capture empirically observed behavior of people's attitudes towards gains/losses as well as to risks in those domains.
1146,Does trade lead to economic growth in the most basic models of trade?,"It depends on how you define ""growth"". Trade models have multiple goods in them, so there's no unique way to define ""growth"" - you are just moving along a fixed production possibility frontier. You can calculate nominal GDP, but then you have to come up with a measure of inflation so that you can deflate the nominal figure into something real. "
1147,Any major theory/model that considers return due to idiosyncratic risk?,"There are no major models that come to the conclusion that idiosyncratic risk can drive positive returns. The reason is that idiosyncratic risk is diversifiable. The models, however, do in fact consider idiosyncractic risk. The theories don't forget or ignore them. It just turns out that this risk doesn't matter."

1151,Has US real median personal/household income been stagnant since the late 1970's/early 1980's?,"As said in the comments, there is an important difference between household income and wages. Household income includes income from capital. As a higher share of total income is going to capital than to labour (see below), you would expect a divergence between household and wages. "
1152,Understanding at a quote about externalities in law and economics,"You don't give the source of the quote, but presumably what is meant is this.  Whether X's production or consumption of a good affects Y (in a physical way such as smoke from X's factory or noise from X's playing loud music, not merely through the workings of the price system) is a matter of fact.  On the other hand, whether X is required (assuming a negative effect) to bear the costs of the harm to Y, is a matter of law.  The implication seems to be that an externality is present only if the law does not so require."

1154,Why does lowering interest rates transfer incomes from households to corporations?,A student of mine came up with a very plausible explanation for this statement. I think he's almost certainly on the right lines.
1155,Infinite Horizon Transversality Condition,"Your confusion comes from the fact that you treat the Transversality condition as a constraint, while it is a condition for optimality. So the formulation at the end of your question is wrong. What you do is you solve your model as usual, and then check if the solution (here the balanced growth path) satisfies the Transversality condition."

1157,Lucas Cost of Business Cycles,"The Lucas model does not address at all the points that you address of people losing jobs, as it utilizes just one agent that simply has a perfectly steady (perhaps growing at a constant rate) consumption path. A model with heterogeneous agents where they have the possibility of losing their jobs and having some periods with, supposedly, very low consumption, would give a much higher cost of business cycles."
1158,How come the average studio rent in Vietnam is bigger than the average salary?,"The rent figure in the question relates to the centre of Ho Chi Minh City and it is a fallacy to infer that it is typical of the whole of Vietnam.  There is a body of theory going back to von Thunen suggesting that land rents will generally fall with distance from a city centre, forming a rent gradient. Given a free market in land and property, residents and entrepreneurs will choose where to live or site their businesses with regard both to price and to costs of travel and transport, and this tends to result in such a gradient in land rents.  Property rents will depend on the size and type of property as well as land rents per unit of area, but otherwise similar properties will tend to be cheaper with greater distance from a city centre."

1165,Define and characterize equilibria of the following game,SOLUTION: 
1166,"Linear Expenditure System of Demands, Derivation Help","I am not sure I understand your question. $\lambda$ is a Lagrange multiplicator which has a value in the optimum. It is not a parameter and hence you cannot leave it in your solution.
 When solving the Lagrangian the optimal solution has the form $(x,\lambda)$ and in addition to your conditions
$$x_1 = \frac{\alpha}{\lambda p_1} + b_1$$
$$x_2 = \frac{\beta}{\lambda p_2} + b_2$$
$$x_3 = \frac{\gamma}{\lambda p_3} + b_3$$
it also has to fulfill
$$
(p \cdot x - w) \lambda = 0.
$$
If $\lambda \neq 0$ this also means $p \cdot x = w$. $\lambda$ cannot be equal to zero because it is in the denominator of your optimal solution for $x$:
$$x(p,w) = (b_1, b_2, b_3) + \left(\frac{\alpha}{\lambda p_1},\frac{\beta}{\lambda p_2},\frac{\gamma}{\lambda p_3}\right)$$
and hence you were correct to use the Walras law or budget constraint."
1167,Are White's Robust standard errors robust to clustered errors?,No. White's robust errors are only robust to errors that vary linearly based on X(t).  If you have a type of serial correlation or clustering you will want to use Hansen method to adjust standard errors.
1168,Why is a higher inflation rate bad for international competitiveness?,"Competitiveness simply means how expensive goods of a country are when compared. To correctly compare we would need to transform everything into a(ny) single currency. To do this correctly we need two elements: a) the actual price of the good and b) its exchange rate. If a country has higher inflation, then nominal prices increase, the goods are more expensive, less desirable and therefore due to (a) competitiveness decreases."
1169,Selection bias - Will multiple regressions solve the problem?,"What you are referring to is two-stage least squares. This is an instrumental variable commonly applied to correct for endogeniety and selection bias. It is a pretty hot topic in economics at the moment and, when applied correctly, can be very useful and will remove the selection bias."

That's something of an understatement. His contributions are not just in the pricing of carbon; they but span microeconomics, macroeconomics, (econometric and other) modelling, the philosophy of economics, and the economics of innovation."
1181,What is the most general definition of “the core” in game theory?,"We can talk of the core for any arbitrary game. To explain how let me compare it directly to how we define non-cooperative games. In a standard non-cooperative game we define Players, $I$, action sets for each player, $A_i$ for each $i\in I$ and payoff functions that map any profile of actions to payoffs $u_i: A\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, where $A=\prod_{i\in I} A_i$. Finally the solution concept, for example, Nash equilibrium, correlated equilibrium or rationalizability is a condition on these objects that we think are a good prediction of what will happen. For instance, Nash equilibrium predicts that every player is best responding to a correct belief about what other players are doing. "
1182,Could anyone here be able to explain gambling addiction and its debt with Microeconomics theory?,It seems to me that the topic is related to rational addiction: Individual preferences for consuming $x_t$ are conditioned by their past consumption $x_{t-1}$. See for instance:
1183,Alternatives to avoid sanctions,"You have most of the explanation here - the only missing piece is that as the de facto reserve currency of the world, almost all global trade is conducted in US dollars.  Typically what happens is that a buyer will convert local currency to \$USD, the \$USD will be exchanged in the transaction, and then the seller will convert that \$USD to their local currency."
1184,Is there a reproducibility crisis in Economics?,There is a general reproducibility crisis in most fields of science including economics. First economics is actually doing quite well compared to other social sciences for example this study shows 54% of studies that authors tried to replicate in psychology could not be replicated but this study for economics shows only about 40% failed to replicate. This being said 40% is quite a lot.

1195,Money Metric Utility Function: Budget constraints become Utility Functions?,"$m(\mathbf p,\mathbf x)$ specifies the minimum amount of money required for a consumer to attain the same utility as consuming bundle $\mathbf x$, taking prices $\mathbf p$ as given. In other words, since all bundles on the same indifference curve as $\mathbf x$ have the same utility value, and to achieve this utility, one needs at least an income of $m(\mathbf p,\mathbf x)$, we can thus establish a one-to-one mapping between utility levels and income levels. As utility is ordinal, we could as well use income as our utility measure. "
1196,Intuition behind Real Money Demand and Real Money Supply,"They're in monetary units! Let's say an economy has a money supply of $100$ $mu$ and a price level of $1$. Another economy has the same money supply but a price level of $1.5$. Which economy has the bigger real money supply? The first, obviously. In the first hypothetical economy, you can think of the average transaction as one involving smaller amounts of currency. Real money demand will of course depend on nominal income $Y$. An increase in nominal income makes people demand more money because there's more transactions to be made. "
1197,The Shapiro-Stiglitz model. Why under full employment do unemployed workers find jobs instantly?,"I think that the confusion is caused by the different meaning of ""full employment"" in both contexts."
1198,Quasiconcavification,"In one dimension if the functions $f_i$ are bounded, e.g. defined on a compact interval, then yes. Take $g_1$ such that it makes $f_1$ almost constant, e.g. $g_1(x)=\frac{x}{N(\max f_1-\min f_1)}$ where $N>0$ is large. Take $g_2(x)=x$ Then $g_1\circ f_1+g_2\circ f_2\approx f_2$, which is strictly quasiconcave by assumption. "
1199,Bayesian Mechanism vs Prior-free Mechanism,You may need to provide more information for a clear answer. How does the mechanism look like in detail? What is the goal you want to achieve?
1200,Proving existence of utility function,Το take this one out of the Unanswered queue:
1201,What are the most used approximations in economics?,"There are four categories of approximations used in economics.  Unfortunately, none of them are economic approximations, but rather mathematical or statistical approximations.  As such, they do not appear in the economic literature, so much so as in the mathematical literature.  You are not seeing in the economic literature because students should be exposed to the content by mathematicians."
1202,Differences between GMM and MSM?,"While in GMM one uses theoretical analytical moments, in MSM one uses simulated theoretical moments instead. "
1203,Do governments issue debt at low r to pay debt with high r?,"The phrase governments ""do debt rollover from time to time"" is an understatement. The entire stock of Treasury bills is rolled over continuously, as well as the coupon debt. For example, a 3-month Treasury bill needs to be rolled over four times a year."
1204,Mixed strategies: Nash equilibrium,"Hint 1: Suppose a mixed strategy NE $(\sigma_1,\sigma_2)$ exists, where $\sigma_i$ is a distribution over $[0,1]$. By the property of MSNE, 
$$u_i(x_i,\sigma_j)=u_i(x_i',\sigma_j)$$ 
for all pure strategies $x_i,x_i'$ in the support of $\sigma_i$. "
1205,How does Brouwer's fixed point theorem relate to Walrasian equilibrium?,"In standard proofs of the existence of Walrasian equilibrium, after one applies the appropriate fixed point theorem (typically Kakutani's, but sometimes Brouwer's), one then shows that the given fixed point is, in fact, a Walrasian equilibrium."
1206,Are energy and capital complementary factors of production?,"You say ""energy and capital are complementary factors of production. So for instance if price of energy goes up, so will the price of capital."". I think you might have confused yourself because this kind of positive correlation in prices is not necessarily a property of complements (indeed, often one would expect the reverse to be true)."
1207,Do unsold goods still make it into the GDP?,"2.5 m. Because GDP calculates the final price of Factory goods produced,consumption- which the workers and suppliers spent their cash, and a few other components."
1208,Converse in supermodularity and single-crossing,"I'm not sure there are enough assumptions here to move forward, in particular I would think you would need some conditions on your function $h$, at the very least. It's pretty easy to show that $g(\cdot,\cdot)$ will have increasing differences, which implies the single-crossing property for $g$ (this can be quickly seen by letting $h$ be identically zero). But I don't see how this is enough, since single-crossing doesn't imply supermodularity. Maybe I'm missing something, though."
1209,"Is a country in economic downturn if its growth rate is negative, but improving?","I'm no macroeconomist, so other will correct me if I am wrong, but I would use the following definition:"
1210,"What's wrong with have a 'one second tick' on stock market trades, to prevent high frequency trading? [duplicate]",There is nothing wrong with your idea. Some people may say that it would reduce liquidity - but there is way more than enough liquidity in the system already. HFT is just parasitical - it serves no useful purpose.
1211,Rigorous proof needed: Acemoglu (Intro Growth) Corollary $2.1.2$,"The OP correctly identified a mistake here. Since the author claims monotonicity for a general function, let's disprove it for the simple linear case.
Consider"
1212,Do heterogeneity in consumption baskets lead to very different inflation rates for different consumers?,"This question is essentially about the representativeness of agents in economic models, and so the answer is yes and no."
1213,Why is deflation not considered the opposite of inflation?,"People think that inflation is bad when it gets out of control, say when its more than 3 or 4% a year. The idea is that we all make economic decisions based on prices and its harder to make those decisions when the prices are constantly changing! Moreover, we try to avoid holding on to money and committing to a price for a long time, because we know those become meaningless over time. Also people associate inflation with the ills of fiat money, and other such things."
1214,What is an equilibrium generated by replication?,"For each agent in the economy, create n agents with the same endowment and preferences. The result is the replication economy. Sometimes n is taken to infinity in proofs. 
Chapter 17.I in Mas-Colell explains in detail. Related material is the regularizing effects of aggregation, appendix of Chapter 4."
1215,What is an economic bubble?,"This a highly disputed question! There is a new and interesting paper by Òscar Jordà, Moritz Schularick and Alan M. Taylor about ""Leveraged bubbles"". They study bubbles in housing and equity markets in 17 countries over the past 140 years. "
1216,Do modern economists still believe balance of trade is an important concept in economics?,"The economics of trade can broadly be divided into two parts.  There is a microeconomic part concerned with patterns of trade in particular kinds of goods, their causes such as factor endowments and costs, and effects on welfare, key concepts being comparative advantage and the gains from trade.  Then there is a macroeconomic part concerned with overall volumes of trade and payments for traded goods, and their relations with exchange rates and domestic macroeconomic conditions.  The two parts can be linked, as in the Dekle et al paper referred to by emeryville, but more often are considered separately."
1217,Does a Robinson Crusoe economy have a substitution effect and an income effect?,I don't see why equilibrium $MPL(\ell)$  would be fixed.
1218,Two-player first-price auction with resale,"Let's look at this with backward induction. Let $v_{i}$ be my valuation and $v_{-i}$ be your valuation. Suppose I've won the item. Then $v_{i} \geq v_{-i}$. If I sell you the item at price $v_{-i}$, then my utility is $v_{-i} - b_{i} \leq v_{i} - b_{i}$, where $b_{i}$ is my bid according to the symmetric equilibrium bidding strategy (which may not necessarily be $\beta$). Notice that I do not gain $v_{i}$ by selling you the item, as I do not possess it."
1219,Reference request on “post-scarcity” economics?,A related question is in asking when (if ever) will we be post scarcity. The paper Are We Approaching an Economic Singularity? Information Technology and the Future of Economic Growth by William D. Nordhaus should be of use.
1220,Is MRS supposed to have a minus sign or not? What's there to say about convexity of preferences?,"The Marginal Rate of Substitution is not just the ""ratio of the partial derivatives"": it represents the slope of an indifference curve. In order to obtain it, you must guarantee that you remain on the same indifference curve. How do we do that? One way is by taking the total differential of the utility function and requiring this total differential to be equal to zero:"
1221,Convexity of Walrasian Demand,"I am not sure whether the question asks about the function being convex, or simply the demand correspondence/function being a convex set. The latter is often asked and if that is the case here is an answer."
1222,Why US market is falling due to greece fear?,"As dg99 mentioned the response has actually been relatively muted so far in the American markets  (SPX down 3% or so from its peak).  Generally, problems in major world equity markets cause cascading problems in their trading partners.  In this case there are many American companies that have European stores or otherwise sell into European markets that are affected by the turmoil.  There are secondary effects as well as companies that trade with affected companies feel the pain and so on."
1223,Have the Greek bailouts been included in state budgets Eurozone members?,"I'd like to read more on ""intergovernmental guarantees"", but I believe it's something similar to how the US government implemented the bailout. The 2008 stimulus of $700 bn was the right to spend this money over time. So, this amount entered government spending only gradually. (I think that's also what @BKay's quote says.)"
1224,What term/theory describes more efficient utilization of a resource?,"At the abstract level, this phenomenon is covered by the concept of ""Technological Change"", which, in Economics, does not have a strict/narrow ""Engineering"" interpretation: here, ""Technology"" is not only ""how things are done"" but also ""how things are organized"", and includes also new business models like the one you mentioned (see also this post).  "
1225,How to write the dual problem of this maximization problem?,Everything is explained here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming#Another_example.
1226,Why do money markets fluctuate so much?,"The first reason for which volatility is higher is the liquidity of currencies. It has no storage or transportation costs. It can be used to purchase goods or traded again without additional costs. It doesn't age as fast as some commodities (agricultural products don't last forever). Therefore, the volume of trade is very high, and market participants can very easily enter or exit the market."
1227,Instrumental variables for minimum wage,See abstract (emphasis mine):
1228,Yield and interest rate?,"They are related, but not the same thing."
1229,Generalized KPR: Frisch Elasticity,"Regarding the presence of $l$ in the Frisch elasticity, your result is correct. It is my impression that a Frisch elasticity free of $l$ requires very specific functional forms."
1230,Adjusting GDP for Environmental and Resource Impacts,A good place to start is a report by the U.S. National Academy of Science called Nature's Numbers. The upshot: There is a consensus among economists that it is possible to refine standard measures of GDP rigorously to incorporate adjustments for impacts on environment and natural resources. Implementation is in practice difficult due to data problems. 
1231,Do we have some evidence of overshooting?,It depends on what you mean by overshooting. 
1232,What methods - inspired by Haavelmo’s Structural Econometrics - can show that a partial equilibrium model is unreliable?,I can think of two big ways.
1233,Repeated games without a beginning and an end,What you're asking seems to me just a matter of interpretation. Note that $\mathbb Z$ and $\mathbb Z_+$ have the same cardinality. So it makes no substantive difference which index set you use. 
1234,Has Stack Overflow been economically beneficial to programmer productivity?,"As Andre says, you are after causality, not just correlation. And the best way to find that is exogenous variation - he mentions experiments. Unless you can randomly force some people to use SO - and forbid it to a control group, there is little you can do with true experiments."
1235,How do I change the base year of real GDP using the GDP deflator and nominal GDP?,"It's just nominal GDP in year t, times (deflator in year 2000 / deflator in year t). "
1236,Is there a go-to resources on the use of the scientific method in economics?,Economists often do something similar to what your physics teacher taught. One of my graduate econometrics teachers taught us to begin our empirical investigations by asking what the ideal experiment to test them would be. And a quick web search confirmed this is a widespread sentiment:
1237,Are profits procyclical?,"My reading is yes, it is procyclical in levels and margins. "
1238,Employment Volatility and the Relevance of Aggregate Wage Rigidity,"Wage rigidity is not the only solution to the Shimer Puzzle (Shimer, AER 2005) that has been proposed in the literature, so I wouldn't say that it is the only relevant metric to consider when thinking about labor market dynamics in this context. However, as I understand the question, it aims at the role of wage rigidity in a Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides (DMP) model and not on alternative solutions to the Shimer Puzzle."
1239,What major monetary policy actions were taken during the Great Recession (2007-2009)?,"First, the interest on reserves and the fed funds rate changes:"
1240,"If all firms in an economy are in monopolistic competition with constant elasticity of substitution, can they profit-maximize at $MC=MR=AC$?",The long-run picture for a firm in monopolistically competitive industry should look like this:
1241,Solution of overdetermined system of moment conditions,Here's a little discussion that might help.
1242,Is protectionism more suited to large economies?,"This is partially opinion-based. Even if we were able to calculate all the effects, we can still argue if variant A is better than variant B or vice versa."
1243,Why do some businesses choose scarcity as their business model instead of raising the price to meet the demand?,"Your question is somewhat ill-posed as stated, because none of your examples are good instances of businesses creating artificial scarcity.  Each of them are businesses that face real capacity constraints, whether it be building space and fire-code restrictions or an attempt to manage a sort of tragedy-of-the-commons demeaning of the service.  "
1244,How to get details on all the models used for evaluating ACA?,"In terms of actually getting it passed as legislation, the only evaluation that has any real significance is the one done by the CBO, as that's the official scorecard for Congress and debates that come up on the floor. I have no idea what the specific models they use are called, but I do know they are very linear and simplistic (by design) compared to other mainstream models. It's definitely bound to be a fruitful search if you look there."
1245,Are symmetric equilibria monotone?,"For a simple counterexample let
$$
A = B = \left( \begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 \end{array} \right).
$$
In this game any strategy pair will constitute a Nash-equilibrium. Let
$$
a^t = \left(\frac{2}{3}, \ \frac{1}{3} \right), b^t = \left(\frac{1}{3}, \ \frac{2}{3} \right).   
$$ 
Then the expected payoffs are larger in the symmetric equilibrium associated with $a$."
1246,Markets that are linked to options prices,what are the characteristics of markets that could be predicted with options prices of the present?
1247,Does immiserizing growth exist outside of theory?,"The concept of immiserizing growth describes a situation where a mainly exporter country that grows, finds itself worse-off because the terms of trade (relative prices) change too much against it.  "
1248,Stable marriage problem with transferable utilities,"There's two implementations that should somewhat cover your needs, matchingR which does reduced-form algorithmic matching and matchingMarkets, which estimates estructural matching models with some baysean tools to correct for endogeneity. "
1249,Macroeconomic Measures of Human Capital,The approach developed by Barro and Lee has been used in many empirical analysis. They provide a detailed discussion of how to construct an aggregate human capital measure. 
1250,Utility Maximisation Subject to Income and Time Constraints,Despite its funny title and although it is quite old you may find this paper interesting:
1251,The Next Breakthrough of Growth Economics,"I'm no expert, I'm just now researching this topic for my Master's thesis, and I might miss a bunch of important stuff, but in my opinion, a huge breakthrough might come from the ecological economics side of the debate.
A new (to my knowledge) way of integrating resources and energy into economic growth is to use the so called Exergy (usefull energy) variable in the model. When you use this Exergy (as opposed to simply cost of energy) variable in growth accounting, (again, to my knowledge) it explains away most of the Solow residual. So, ideas, human capital, physical capital and institutions start looking as a really minor factor when you compare them to the amount of calories/watts that we have been using to our advantage throughout the 20-th century...
The implications of the model (I'm speculating a bit here, people who know better could correct me, if I'm wrong) are that it's not that the physical capital per se drives growth, but rather the ability of the capital to extract natural (renewable and expendable) energy resources AND, most importantly, convert those resources into useful work."
1252,Real wage stagnation and union membership,My understanding is that theories and empirical methodologies demonstrating the relationship between declining union membership and wages risk overestimating the causality of the relationship.
1253,Teaching: from Microeconomics to Open-economy macro,"This is for Micro, entirely based on my own opinion and experience. "
1254,Why does the EU need a clearing centre to circumvent US sanctions against Iran?,"Because the US has threatened to sanction European companies that trade with Iran.  Most European companies that are interested in trading in Iran also trade with the US, so would be vulnerable to various kinds of sanctions."
1255,Why does the yield curve flatten?,There is the market segmentation theory. 
1256,How and on what basis the inflation target is determined?,"Recently, at the 2017 Money and Banking Conference at Buenos Aires, the Governors of the Central Bank of Peru and Paraguay talked about this same thing. Those two countries successfully brought inflation from double-digits to ~2% in recent times and they said the changes were opportunistic: if they were sure they'd be able to meet the IT, they changed it."
1257,"How, with complete markets, do we have a representative agent?","It depends on what you want from a representative agent. What you get is a representative agent at the given prices. For any two commodities, you have relative prices. This is where market completeness comes in. All you have to do now is find a well-behaved utility function whose marginal rate of substitution between the commodities corresponds to the relative prices. You can even take the utility function to be linear:
$$u(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_l)=\sum_{i=1}^l x_i/p_i.$$
Of course, the resulting ""representative agent"" is utterly useless for any comparative statics exercise or any welfare analysis."
1258,What are good books on economic world history?,"Rondo Cameron's A Concise Economic History of the World may be helpful. I read an early edition many years ago and it certainly is primarily economic history rather than history of economic thought. One limitation however, identified in this review, is that despite its title it focuses mainly on Europe."
1259,What is the logic behind this sentence in Keynes's General Theory?,"This sentence says something very simple: If labor supply is a function of many arguments, not just the wage, $L^s = f(w,X,Y,...)$, then the supply curve, which is a line in a two-dimensional space of $(L^s,w)$ keeping everything else constant, will shift as a whole(""bodily"") if these $X's$ and $Y's$ change. "
1260,Multidimensional screening and convexity of the surplus/rent function,"First, it's important to be clear about what Rochet proves. In theorem $1$ of Rochet (1987), he shows that cyclical monotonicity is equivalent to the implementability of a mechanism for general environments (i.e. arbitrary allocation/type spaces). (See the statement of theorem $1$, or a standard text such as Borgers (2015), for the definition of cyclical monotonicity.)"

1268,How is money created?,"Re: ""You could say this is 'creating' money"" - no you couldn't. This would be conflating money and wealth. Wealth can be created without new money being created - indeed wealth was created before money even existed. Conversely money can be created without creating wealth. So they are entirely separate things. A crude analogy: wealth is to money as apples are to numbers. You can count apples using numbers, but growing new apples does not create new numbers."

Student type $t_1$ has 10 points to bid based on her GPA. Her favourite courses are A,B,C,D,E.
Student type $t_2$ has 0 points to bid based on his GPA. His favourite courses are F,G,H,I,J.
Student type $t_3$ has 1 point to bid based on her GPA. She ranks the courses alphabetically, A being best, Z being worst. (Or if there are only fifteen courses then O, as that is the 15th letter.) "
1273,How long does it take for shocks to propagate through the price system / market?,"This is likely only part of the story, but I found an interesting lecture by Milton Friedman that shows a graph of the quantity of money per unit of output (likely GDP) graphed alongside a normalized consumer price index (normalized so that the index intersects with the other line in 1970)."

1277,Music Streaming Impact on Producers,"Remember that rivalrous goods mean that someone else consuming it takes some benefit from other people using it--obviously not true for music unless you are a very spiteful consumer. Excludability means you can prevent others from listening to it. Once one person buys it and they start blaring the music, they can't stop others from listening to it, unless they have headphones or something. So it could be considered excludable, but music streaming is often used for parties and such. There is also the issue of torrenting and sharing music online, which makes you the music streamer. So the question to consider is whether music is turning into a public good, and what that means for music streaming."

1281,"Stone-Geary utility function, derivation of Marshallian demand","If I understand your question correctly, you can take the log of the original utility function to simplify the calculations.  The demand derived will be the same as that which is derived from the original utility function.  This follows since the log function is a monotone function, and preferences are preserved under monotonic transformations of utility.  Thus, the ""log-utility"" case that you find online is exactly what you want to work with since it would simplify things quite a bit."
1282,Intuition of the Kolmogorov Equations,"I will try to answer to your last question. I did not read the paper but in models with higher dimensions, it is always difficult to find an analytical solution. 
If there exists an analytical solution (for a very basic model with a one-state variable), it is possible to derive the initial conditions for your control and state variable from your differential equations."
1283,What's the difference between a “consequential” and a “direct” externality?,"According to the examples given in the paper, direct externality results from, among other things, unsolicited promotions, while the sources of indirect / consequential externality are price discrimination, etc. "
1284,Do assets without rental income streams appreciate relative to assets with rental income streams?,I believe he assumes that there is no arbitrage and also that there are no pricing bubbles. So two assets that have the same price today would have the same net present value.

1286,Calculating the cost of a year without land-tilling,"The approach appears to be static. An intertemporal approach would recognize that part of the period's forgone production would have been used for investment, augmenting the capital base. So we also lose future consumption. But let's skip that."
1287,Does consumer surplus over-weigh the interests of high-income consumers?,Consumer surplus in Microeconomics 101 is indeed often used in the way you describe and to illustrate a point about the allocation efficiency of a free market.
1288,why is real wage divided by marginal product of labor often called real marginal cost?,"This relation can be obtained if we realize that Total Cost can be written as a function of output (which in turn is a function of input factors), but also, that Total Cost equals total payments to factors of production.

1298,Relationship between Real Interest Rate and Employment,"You need to connect it to the injections, withdrawals and to the output gap in the Keynesian Cross model. 
As savings increase, planned withdrawals increase in the economy. Consumption decreases, unexpected inventory pile up takes place. Hence firms reduce production and total output is reduced. As output falls unemployment will be more and hence the central bank is going to reduce the interest rate to improve the situation and boost consumption and production.  "

Furthermore, there is a wider range of linear regression tools than just least squares style solutions.  My guess is that you have yet to even come close to covering the linear tools if you are in your third year."
1311,Books friendly to self-studying Industrial Organization,While taking Industrial Organization I remember working with:
1312,What oil price will minimise new resource extraction?,"Let us just assume, without any loss of generality, that it is OPEC nations who can produce oil most cheaply. That is, the cost per barrel for all OPEC nations is homogeneous and is lower than the cost per barrel for any other oil producing nation or entity. "
1313,Why is a high government debt/GDP bad?,"Firstly, the use of debt/GDP as the ratio is somewhat arbitrary. One could easily look at debt/government revenue, and it may be a more useful metric. However, the convention to use GDP for scaling these series. (One can argue that GDP represents the full income capacity of the economy for debt service.)"
1314,What are some good books and articles about the principal-agent problem?,"In my PhD program everyone was using The Theory of Incentives: The Principal-Agent Model by Jean-Jacques Laffont and David Martimort. It offers a formal and relatively complete treatment without being too technical. I haven't read any other book on the topic, so unfortunately I cannot compare."
1315,A few clarifications on Utility equations and indifference curves?,"From a mathematical point of view, the indifference curve is an equation"
1316,Prove that variance of a portfolio cannot exceed variance of individual assets,"Let $w$ denote the weight on $A$ so that $1-w$ is the weight on $B$. 
Recall from the properties of variance that"
1317,What are some further readings in Econometrics you recommend?,"I might be wrong but from what you write, it seems you've been given a ""classical"" introduction to econometrics: You've covered IVs and Diff-in-diff but apparently only in passing, and causal inference does not look like it was the core of the classes you've taken."
1318,Why are some economists remarkably productive?,"A short answer to your question is both yes and no. You have to first define productivity: productivity, in my opinion, cannot simply mean publishing the number of articles, but rather, their impact. A typical way of modelling the impact of authors is by looking at their h-index. There are many other ways of measuring productivity as well- where the articles are published is important as well. The top 5 journals in economics are (in no particular order): Econometrica, AER, QJE, JPE and ReStud. Articles published in these journals are generally of high quality. However, there are many articles that are published in these journals that do not always have the desired impact. Many a time, articles ranked in lower journals have a high impact. Consequently, it is extremely difficult to measure productivity. To me, the h-index is a good measure."
1319,Cash and negative interest rates,"Actually they're saying that, when cash is available, people need not to deposit their money into the bank, and hence is ""guaranteed"" (not taking into account risks associated with holding on to cash, like fire or getting stolen) a 0% interest rate."
1320,Greece default and why are US States not seen defaulting?,Every of the United States except Vermont is required by law to balance their budgets. 45 states have some sort of constitutional balanced budget provision and another 4 have it by statute. (Source)
1321,Could massive derivatives exposures at banks lead to disaster?,Financial intermediaries handle this issue with a few tools:
1322,Game theory software,I have used gambit (python) in the past and could recommend it. It also includes a small GUI which makes things very intuitive.
1323,What are some important mathematics results that were first developed in Economics?,"I know a lot of examples of mathematical results that have been first developed in economics, mostly result in set-valued analysis and convex analysis. My ignorance of engineering and physics keeps me from listing many examples there. Many results in optimal transport have certainly been used in many other areas."
1324,What are good mathematics books to learn decision theory?,"I do not know about social choice, but for utility representations I think the two most cited books are ""Convex analysis"" by Rockafellar and ""Infinite Dimensional Analysis: A Hitchhiker's Guide"" by Alliprantis and Border. They contain most (if not all) results on convex analysis and functional analysis used by economists."
1325,Is economics a science based more on statistics (observations) rather than rigorous reasoning?,"At the very foundation of sciences like Physics, rest relations and properties that they just are, no explanation can be given, but they have been found directly or indirectly to continue to hold, or at least to change at an inconsequential rate compared to the time-span (or space-span) of humans.  "
1326,When a support function is found to be more profitable than the primary business,The Aerobie Sports company mostly makes odd-ball equipment for having a catch. But they made a coffee maker called the Aeropress as a side project and now it makes up more than half of their sales. 
1327,Is education a part of the U.S. exports component of GDP?,Education is indeed in exports according to the US Government's Trade.gov website:
1328,Questions of the type “What do you think other people would think?”,Epistemic game theory would be the closest (sub-)field that deals with questions involving higher order beliefs among interacting agents. 
1329,Do free-trade economies typically offer any protection for domestic markets?,"I think the (or at least, a) relevant concept is that of non-tariff barriers to trade. Wikipedia has a nice summary."
1330,Why is the Marginal Cost (MC) of a monopoly horizontal,That is basically an assumption here. Often in monopoly problems we assume constant marginal costs (i.e. a linear cost function) to keep things simple. In that case the Marginal Cost Curve is horizontal in the graph.
1331,Do discontinuous preferences imply no continuous utility function?,"The easiest way to prove it is using the 'old' definition of continuity. 
$\succ$ is continuous iff whenever $x\succ y$, there exists neighborhoods of $x$ and $y$, $B_x, B_y$, such that all $z\in B(x)$ and $z'\in B(y)$, $z\succ z'$."
1332,Why are elasticities defined as logarithmic derivatives?,"If I understand your question, first the elasticity haven't units. The problem with $\partial Y/\partial X$ is that if you change the measure units the result is different. Is less problematic to express it in percentages:
$$ El_X(Y)=\frac{\Delta Y/Y}{\Delta X/X}$$
if $\Delta Y \to 0$ when $\Delta X \to 0$ then you obtain $$El_X(Y)=\frac{dY}{dX}\frac{X}{Y}$$ if $Y=Y(X,W,...,Z)$ you change $d$ for $\partial$."
1333,Just how much calculus is involved in the study of economics?,Calculus is one of the most widely-used branches of mathematics in economics. Here are two (non-exhaustive) examples of important ways in which economists use calculus:
1334,Why do Higher Interest Rates attract Foreign Investors?,The answer lies in this part of your posted quote: 
1335,Can an economy grow without its population growing?,"Yes, there can be economic growth without population growth."
1336,Math basics for Macro&Micro economics and econometrics,I recommended familiarity with the following topics: 
1337,Is my logic on taxation for this question legit?,The burden of taxation is shared among suppliers and demanders according to the price elasticities of supply and demand. The more elastic side carries less of the tax burden.
1338,Sum of Homothetic Functions,"Defn: A function $h:\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is homogenous of degree $k$ if for every nonzero $\alpha$, $h(\alpha x, \alpha y)=\alpha^k h(x,y)$."
1339,What did Adam Smith mean by “putting [the pins] into the paper”?,"Alecos is correct that Smith is talking about packaging, but I don't believe that ""paper"" refers to a paper bag."
1340,Is “management science” a subsection of economics?,"The journal Management Science is a decent one. Many economists do publish on that journal. In fact, a quick look at its editorial board reveals many notable names, with the recent Nobel laureate in Economics Richard Thaler among the associate editors."
1341,Why is gold a safe haven investment?,"You could see it as a coordination game and an example of a rational bubble. Because everybody knows that people start buying gold and the price goes up when the economy tanks, it is actually a good strategy to do just that. Similar things happen for example with the Swiss Franc."
1342,Name for a slightly-stronger than Nash Equilibrium?,This is a strict Nash Equilibrium.
1343,Gold coins as currency?,Here are three types of money:
1344,Including (demand) price elasticity in a price regression model,"The incorporation of a price elasticity in your regression requires that your dependent variable, quantity,  be logged as well."
1345,Variable cost as the sum of marginal cost,You can obtain variable cost as the sum of a series in this case because the given formula for marginal cost is linear. But there is a much simpler way.
1346,Cobb-Douglas and Logarithm Utility Functions,"Utility functions are invariant with respect to positive monotonic transformations (PMT).
Take $U(x,y)=x^\alpha y^{1-\alpha}$, and let $V(x,y)=\log(U(x,y))$ be a PMT of $U$. 
Thus $V$ and $U$ both represent the same preference, and thus demand functions for $x$ and $y$ are the same."
1347,What keeps minimum wage rates in balance?,"Yes and no. It is a political choice, but with economic reasoning. In the end, that's the case for every economic rule, maybe with the exception of monetary rules, as we try to preserve independence for central bankers (but it isn't completely true for the US FEDs)."
1348,What's the opposite of a Pareto improvement called?,"I usually use the phrase ""Pareto worsening"". It is not really widespread, in fact I am not sure I have ever heard anyone else use it. However now I googled it and people seem to use it in connection with Hart's 1975 paper wherein he shows that the opening of some new markets can make every agent worse off. Hart himself did not call this Pareto worsening, but other scholars do. An example is on page 230 of volume II of General Equilibrium, Growth, and Trade. Here is the same phrase used in Information and Securities: A Note on Pareto Dominance and the Second Best."
1349,Does GDP count both the investment and the house rental?,"You are correct that what you describe would be an overcount, but fortunately, your description of what is counted in GDP is incorrect. When a new home is constructed and sold, the full sales price is not counted in GDP. Instead, only the value of the construction put in place is counted in GDP— when the construction is completed. Then, the value of the stream of housing services (i.e., the imputation for owners' equivalent rent) is counted annually as an output of the asset."
1350,Good books to learn social choice theory,Start with:
1351,Oil Price Chart Scale,"Usually, when people use non-equidistant axis, it is because they want to emphasize some variation more than others. For example, if most of your data is between 0 and 1, but you have one outlier on 100, then an equidistant axis would make it hard to analyze most the variation, because it emphasizes the wrong parts."
1352,Existence of solution to maximization problem,"It is most likely that the statement is in the form of 'A utility maximization problem on a compact set has a solution when the utility function is continuous.' In the one dimensional case, this is a direct corollary of the extreme value theorem. A reference to this theorem can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_value_theorem "
1353,Book Recommendation: Price Theory,by Donald N. McCloskey
1354,What would be the defining characteristic of New-Keynsian thought?,"Gali's Monetary Policy, Inflation, and the Business Cycle: An Introduction to the New Keynesian Framework, provides an advanced undergraduate / first-year graduate student introduction to these models, and I'd recommend it for self studies. According to chapter 1, available online, which offers an overview of the  New Keynesian Model, the key elements are:"
1355,Literature Recommendation: Advanced Undergraduate Economics,I would suggest Mankiw and EconTalk (despite my Keynesian leanings). 
1356,Is it reasonable to consider government bonds as money,"Unfortunately, economists have no consensus definition of money."
1357,How to close the gap between non-Econ background and Macroeconomics,"Surprisingly, I think the best way would be to read a Microeconomics textbook. You described difficulties with concepts like market clearing conditions. Macroeconomic models are usually based on general equilibrium models which students of Macroeconomics learn in their Microeconomics education. Consider reading the relevant parts of an intermediate Microeconomics textbook or Mas-Colell, Whinston + Green's classic Micro textbook for PhD students."
1358,Why stochastic dominance is “stochastic”?,"In the below figure, CDF $F(\cdot)$ is first-order stochastically dominated by $G(\cdot)$. But $X_1$ and $X_2$ fall within the support of both distributions. So it would be possible to draw $X_1$ from $F$ and $X_2$ from $G$, or to draw $X_2$ from $F$ and $X_1$ from $G$."
1359,Analyzing Farm Bureau's claim that milk prices would double at the retail level if all the illegals were deported,"It is worth noting that OP's original question before I edited it asked, ""why would economists lie to us?"" This already leaves a poor taste in my mouth; such a question is loaded enough as it is, only good for picking fights. The author stated at the bottom of the Progressive Dairy article is a lawyer, not an economist, and seems to be the basis for some of your figures in your analysis. The article from the Texas A&M AgriLife study cited by the Farm Bureau/NMPF did have economists writing on the topic, which I'll discuss briefly later."
1360,Advanced economies tend to slide down to zero interest rates and stay there. Why? [closed],Recently I read an interesting paper on this subject from the Bank for International Settlements:
1361,Risk Premium in the Expected Utility Theory,Is there any (economic) rational for the first-order expansion of the RHS? And for its different neighborhood evaluation?
1362,"Why labour, capital, and output levels cannot be pinned down in perfect competition?","Thus, the furthest we can go in terms of characterising the equilibrium in this economy/firm relates to the optimal capital-labour ratio. In effect, nothing can be said about the level of inputs and outputs, $L^*$, $K^*$, or $Y^*$."
1363,Tax by inflation,It's called seigniorage. This actually goes on to some degree in every country. I don't think any country has ever relied solely on this to cover all its expenses. (Those that come close usually suffer from hyperinflation.)
1364,How can I tell if 2 different utility functions represent the same preferences?,Recall the definition:
1365,How did the derivatives market 'collapse' in 2008?,"The question is quite complex and an answer should be far beyond looking only at the structure of the derivatives, but i try my best."
1366,What's the best reference for rigorous study of mixed-strategy nash equilibrium?,"The book by Gibbons that Tobias mentions is titled ""A Primer in Game Theory"" in Europe. It is excellent, especially in its coverage of more advanced games of imperfect/incomplete information. But it is quite concise in its treatment of games of complete information like the ones you are studying. The book by Osborne might therefore be a better choice. Both of these books are aimed at the introductory graduate level and are therefore quite rigorous.*"
1367,Canonical set of books covering Bachelors and Masters in Economics?,Econ isn't as sequential as physics. The two core undergrad classes that everyone takes are Intermediate Micro and Intermediate Macro. Varian is the standard for Intermediate Micro.
1368,Can people lack a comparative advantage and a comparative disadvantage?,Comparative advantage doesn't work like that.
1369,Notation conventions for superscripts and subscripts,This is only partial answer since your question is quite broad but in my work I had similar problems. 
1370,Scaling Adjustment Costs,The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics Article on Adjustment Costs gives a nice overview of the use of adjustment costs in economic models. 
1371,How is capital outflow calculated?,"The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) gives tons of statistics. Take a look at ""Net Inflows/Outflows of Capital by Private Sector"" and “Balance of Payment” in different representations. I warn you ahead that it’s not that clear from the data what moves where. "
1372,"“If markets are competitive, the rate of return on capital equals its marginal product, $f'(k)$ minus depreciation $\delta$”?",This is not proven in Romer but it is a well known result. To derive it mathematically you need to take the following steps:
1373,How popular are alternative standard of living measures amongst economists?,This question is somewhat subjective but I'll attempt to provide an answer.
1374,Does the Efficient Market Hypothesis Solve the Tragedy of the Commons?,Your description of the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) is not correct.
1375,Is the development of “developing countries” evidence against the idea that former colonial powers owe their headway to exploitation?,"To complement @rocinante answer the argument described in the question silently assumes that growth can happen only if you steal from somebody. So if the past colonies cannot steal from anybody, they are bound not to ameliorate their material welfare. "
1376,What does 'intelligent money' mean?,"""Intelligent money"" or ""smart money"" is not an economic term per se, but a finance term."
1377,"General model of economics, economics as mathematical structure","This is inherently wrong reasoning. Economics is, above all, a philosophical discipline, and not an applied mathematics. What you have heard about tuples is about the modern ""neoclassical"" economics (I used quotation marks, because this term is not entirely accurate). So, this is just one approach to do economics."
1378,What is the function of capitalism? [closed],"Capitalism is defined as an economic and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit, rather than by the state."

1380,Quantitative Marxian/Marxist micro and macro economic models?,"There is a very interesting paper by John Roemer, published in Econometrica in 1980, that presents a mathematical general equilibrium Marxian model. I am not sure someone have ever estimated it though. Find it here (subscription required)."
1381,"Is the Cobb-Douglas Utility Function Locally Non-Satiated at (0,0)?",No.
1382,"because bitcoins do not generate earnings, then (it is a ponzi scheme)?","What is the reasoning behind the notion that because bitcoin has no intrinsic 
  value therefore it's not suitable as currency? Or, to put another way, if no one 
  ""held"" US dollars, but simply used them to spend or invest, would that 
  invalidate it as a currency for buying chickens?"

1384,How do I represent this indifference curve graphically?,"The problem is that there are no indifference ""curves"" but indifference ""areas"". Consider the following graph:"
1385,Strict preference relations and utility representations,"Yes it is: 
If direction
$$
x \succ y \Rightarrow x \not \precsim y \Rightarrow u(x) > u(y).
$$
Only if direction: 
For all $x, y  \in X$, 
$$
x \succsim y \iff u(x) \geq u(y)
$$
implies
$$
x \sim y \iff u(x) = u(y).
$$
Also
$$
u(x) > u(y) \Rightarrow u(x) \geq u(y) \Rightarrow  x \succsim y ,
$$
$$
u(x) > u(y) \Rightarrow u(x) \not = u(y) \Rightarrow  x \not\sim y.

and
$$
x \succsim y \mbox{ AND } x \not\sim y \Rightarrow x \succ y.

1386,Method of Lagrange multipliers with random variables,"If you treat $c_2$ as if it is a random variable, then the derivative of
  $E[u(c_2)]$ with respect to $c_2$ gives zero."
1387,Are these preferences consistent with rationality?,"You implicitly assume that the utility of $n$ units of $Y$ equals $n$ times the utility of 1 unit of $Y$, and there is no reason for that. For instance, if $Y$ is a fridge, the gain in utility from having 1 fridge compared to 0 is certainly larger than the gain in utility from having 2 fridges compared to 1. The formula $U(""nY"")=n*U(""Y"")$ that you use does not make sense: there are utility functions other than $U$ that represent the same preferences over $\{X,Y,Z\}$, and you will reach different conclusions if you make the same computation with these utilities."
1388,Demand curve from logit model,"We cannot obtain ""demand"" in the usual sense, because demand is a random variable. The ""best"" we can do is first, to obtain the Conditional Expectation of individual demand (conditional on the variables that determine the probability of whether the consumer will demand/buy).
Let a situation where consumers decide to buy or not to buy a single (for simplicity) item of a good $A$. We can model this underlying utility framework by"
1389,Financial Economics Textbooks,"The recommended books are decent. From these two I'd go with Bailey first and if you're comfortable with that, then LeRoy & Werner. The latter requires some background in linear algebra and optimization theory."
1390,DSGE models (Dynare) are only based on simulations and approximations? (without data),"It doesn't seem like you've tried very hard to find estimation using Dynare (google results of ""Dynare estimation""). Dynare is in fact capable of doing estimation and typically people use some sort of data to estimate the parameters that govern their model."
1391,Why didn't the money printing by the US Federal Reserve since 2008 lead to inflation?,Because you can't push on a piece of string.
1392,What graph theory textbook should I use?,"Social and Economic Networks, by Matthew O. Jackson, and its associated MOOC at https://www.coursera.org/course/networksonline (videos from the 2014 session available, new live session starting September 2015)."
1393,Does everyone prosper through development projects?,"A lot of this comes down to risk. A developing country usually don't have very strong ""institution"" and are much more prone to various kinds of crisis (think military coup, hyperinflation, terrorist attack, nationalization*). An investor might also not be as familiar with the developing country in question* (and hence the risk)."
1394,Sequential vs. trembling hand perfect equilibrium,"Yes. In a normal form game, every Nash equilibrium is also a sequential equilibrium. But not every Nash equilibrium is trembling hand perfect. Consider the game in which each of two players has two strategies, A and B. Both players get payoff 0 except in one case: they achieve positive payoffs if they both choose A. Then (A,A) and (B,B) are two Nash equilibria of this game. Both are therefore also sequential equilibria. However, (B,B) is not trembling hand perfect. If there is even the smallest tremble in player 2's choice, player 1 has a strict preference for A. Only (A,A) is trembling hand perfect. The generalization of this is that Nash equilibria in which some players play weakly dominated strategies are not trembling hand perfect. "
1395,What is the difference between a Start-Up and a small company which is not a Start-Up?,"Probably, there's no clear-cut definition, however, there's an article of Paul Graham called Startup=Growth which represents the opinion many agree upon: startup is a company that plans to grow fast (... and scale). A quote:"
1396,Intuition: Why does perfectly elastic supply imply no producer surplus?,"If it costs you 50 cents a bag to make popcorn and you sell it for 50 cents a bag, you come out ahead by 0 cents a bag."

1399,Taxes levied on sellers = Taxes levied on buyers,"Whether the tax is imposed on the buyer or the seller doesn't make any practical difference. It's just an accounting detail. One might even say, it's just an accounting trick."
1400,How to borrow at risk free rate,"A private person will almost never have an access to borrowing at risk free rate. However, governments such as Germany or Switzerland can borrow at essentially for all practical purposes at risk free rate by issuing government bonds."
1401,Did capitalism exist before the 18th century?,"According to some yes. In this (historically oriented) view, whatever succeeded feudalism is called capitalism. "
1402,Interpretation of Solution Concepts,"One reason why there exists no ultimate overview is that these issues are still under debate. A great entry point would be the survey ""Foundations of Strategic Equilibrium"" by John Hillas and Elon Kohlberg in Volume 3 of the Handbook of Game Theory with Economic Applications. A preprint version of the survey can be found here."
1403,How does expected utility theory treat losses?,"Gains and losses presuppose a reference point, which is not a feature in standard expected utility theory. In this theory, the only argument in the utility over wealth is $w$, the absolute level of wealth. A common form of utility function is the constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) form: 
\begin{equation}
u(w)=\frac{w^{1-\rho}}{1-\rho},
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is the coefficient of relative risk aversion. Note that this incorporates the commonly seen $\sqrt w$ and $\ln w$ forms when $\rho$ is $\frac12$ and $1$, respectively. As is obvious, there is no term that helps differentiate between gains and losses in this formulation. The graph for a standard EU function with risk aversion is the same as any strictly increasing and strictly concave function. "

1405,Quasi-Linear Functions,"The indifference curves are not ""parallel"", as they are not straight lines. They are however shifted, that is they are supposed to maintain vertical distance regardless of the value of $x$. "
1406,Doubt on a simple problem from Mankiw's Macroeconomics,"In theory, yes. If there are perfect** (and mutually exclusive) substitutes, and exactly the same amount of money is spent on those substitutes (and individuals would not have spent that money otherwise), then GDP could remain constant.However, even for extremely simple goods, this is unlikely."
1407,Can marginal revenue be increasing?,"It is perfectly consistent for the marginal revenue to increase in $q$, even if the demand curve decreases."
1408,How do you reconcile the Law of Increasing Opportunity Costs and Economies of Scale?,"You are correct that an uniformly increasing cost of production cannot exist alongside economies of scale. A constant returns to scale production function is homogeneous of degree one:
$$ f(\lambda x, \lambda y) =  \lambda  \cdot f(x, y)$$
That is, when you double all the inputs you also double the output. An increasing returns to scale production function is one for $\lambda > 1$ (so that you actually increase the resources) in which $f(\lambda x, \lambda y) >  \lambda  \cdot f(x, y)$  (e.g. double the inputs and more than double the outputs for at least some combinations of inputs). However, it is problematic for a production function to have increasing returns to scale for all levels of inputs. Increasing returns to scale means fewer and fewer inputs are needed for each marginal unit of output. This generally means that marginal cost of production is also falling. This has all sorts of bizarre consequences, including the potential for indeterminacy (multiple equilibrium levels of output), downward sloping supply curves, and equilibrium non-existence. We also don't generally think it is true in reality. It is widely observed that beyond a certain scale most industries do not exhibit further returns to scale. For some industries, like dry cleaning, this scale is quickly reached, for others, like automobile manufacturing or social networks it may be very large indeed. But we generally believe that eventually the marginal cost of production will rise with scale. Even if we bought exactly the same car in same color, we'd still eventually want so many that the cost of labor, rubber, and metal would rise from that demand, driving up the marginal cost. We also face dis-economies of scale like managerial incentive problems and other  difficulties of managing and controlling an increasingly large institution."

1414,How can the abuses of monopoly power lead to market failure?,"First, let's be clear what we mean by abuse of dominance: this is when a firm is a monopoly or near-monopoly, and attempts to use that position in order to perpetuate or enhance its dominance of the market at the expense of competition."

1418,The Printing of Money for Paying Debt,"Printing money causes inflation because someone (or some institution) will get the money and will spend it somehow. This increases demand for goods, but the number of goods, the supply was not affected by printing money. Hence demand at the old price level is larger than supply at the old price level. Prices will rise until a new equilibrium is reached."
1419,Doing a PhD Economics without background in formal theorems?,"I did my undergraduate double majoring in discrete mathematics and economics. I went through the grad micro sequence, the math for economists grad course, and the game theory field course, though. So I have a good idea of what the courses are like on both ends. (Doing the grad school route now, but that's additional commentary with which I won't bore everyone)."
1420,How are disaster effects calculated into GDP?,"GDP is just a partial measure of flow. There are lots of changes to the stock of a nation, its capital, that are not captured by GDP."

Even though the existing capital plays a part, the lowest of deprecation rate is around 25 years IIRC, so by and large the wealth is not inherited, but created by the generation."
1422,“For a market to exist there must be scarcity” (T/F),"I agree that air is not, in any meaningful sense, scarce. But there is no market in air! There is a market in canned air, but that's different because canned air is most definitely scarce."
1423,Numerical analysis in economics,"Read the theory and then try coding. But you're lucky, because I was eager to develope and implement the forward shooting algorithm myself and thus provide it."
1424,Could debt cause inflation instead of deflation?,Yes it can.
1425,Dominated Strategies in an Infinitely vs Finitely Repeated Game,A usual refinement concept used to deal with weakly dominated strategies is the trembling hand perfect equilibrium. (I do not know others but this one works quite well.
1426,How to derive utility possibility frontier?,"Given that $u_A(x_A, y_A) = \sqrt{x_Ay_A}$, $u_B(x_B, y_B) = \sqrt{x_By_B}$ are the utility functions of A and B, and total endowment of X and Y in this pure exchange economy is $\omega_X$ and $\omega_Y$, utility possibility frontier (UPF) is the set of all utility pairs $(\mu_A, \mu_B)$ such that the there exist a Pareto optimal allocation $((x_A, y_A), (x_B, y_B))$ with the property: $\mu_A = u_A(x_A, y_A)$ and $\mu_B = u_B(x_B, y_B)$. So to find UPF, we will use the following conditions:"
1427,Properties of Financial Markets in Real Life,"Equilibria: in the macroeconomic sense of aggregate equilibrium where all markets clear, markets are most likely never in any equilibrium but rather in constant flux between different equilibria, because the market clearing macroeconomic equilibrium always depends on real and also in short run nominal factors which constantly change. Hence it does not make sense to say whether the markets are currently in equilibrium or not. However, textbooks use the concept of such equilibrium because it is very useful way of describing states toward which the markets gravitate - you can imagine them as a screenshot of a continuously playing movie."
1428,Interpreting how graphs of Cobb-Douglas utility functions. How does MRS vary as we vary $\alpha$?,"I think it is important to note that $MRS(x,y)$ is a function. There is exactly one indifference curve passing through $(x,y)$. $MRS(x,y)$ shows the steepness of this curve at point $(x,y)$. Then $\frac{\partial MRS(x,y)}{\partial \alpha}$ would show how much steeper the indifference curve passing through $(x,y)$ gets at this point if you change the parameter $\alpha$."
1429,"Determining cost from production function, wage, and rental rate","A) If we care about not making losses,"
1430,Preparation for the rigors of an economics graduate programme,I'd work my way through Microeconomic Analysis by Hal Varian (the PhD level one) and Mathematics for Economists by Simon and Bloom. You'll need both the micro intuition  of the former and mastery of the math bits of the the latter. You'll need thornier and more technical books at some point but these authors will hold your hand enough to work through them solo.
1431,Why do there seem to be relatively few imports from India into the United States?,"India has significantly worse physical/logistics infrastructure than China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan, so it is difficult to produce goods in India because it's difficult to move supplies and product around the country.  This, coupled with the comparatively higher complexity of dealing with government bureaucracy, makes it challenging to manufacture products in India for export."
1432,"Do any social welfare functionals, other than maximin, meet all of Arrow's conditions plus invariance regarding ordinal level comparability?",There are at least two other examples of SWFs that satisfy these conditions.
1433,Efficient Market Hypothesis and constant ex-ante real interest rates?,"Tests of the efficient markets hypothesis must always include a model of how the market forms prices. One of Fama's big contributions was that you cannot separate these two things in a test. Tests of efficient markets and models of price formations are inherently linked. So, in this case, the assumption of constant real interest rates is merely an assumption of how the market forms prices. Only after assuming this, can we test market efficiency. You might disagree with the model---more sophisticated models will repeat this experiment in that way---but the point is that you have to assume some model for price formation."
1434,How to make unequally spaced grid?,"One quick way to do this is through inverting a distribution c.d.f.. For example, the distribution Beta(alpha,beta) has density concentrated at small and large values when alpha and beta are less than one. Thus, you can first generate equally spaced grid, and then use the inverse function of Beta c.d.f to map the grid to unequally spaced grid. You can change the percentiles you want (60-70%, e.g.) by setting the appropriate alpha and beta. "
1435,In econometrics what are induced jobs?,"Induced jobs are those created by the spending of those employed directly by the primary source or indirectly by suppliers to the source.  For example, you have a project to build a bridge.  That project hires a worker.  That worker stops at a convenience store every morning and buys a coffee and a bagel.  The people responsible for selling the coffee and bagel are induced jobs.  This includes the cashier, the stock person, the delivery person, the baker, etc.  "
1436,What are the units of utility?,"No, you can not really say that. Here is the reason:"
1437,Is utility in neoclassical economics a circular argument/concept?,Let's be clear--the concept of utility is both unfalsifiable (as a singular proposition) and useful.
1438,Why does a company want the value of its stocks to be as high as possible?,One way of raising funds is by issuing new (additional) shares. The price of the new shares will largely depend on the current share price.
1439,Social Welfare and Pareto Optimality in a Bayesian Game,"While it is a bit unusual to describe a strategy profile as being Pareto optimal, especially in the context of Bayesian games, I guess you can still define Pareto optimality in different stages of such games as follows. Recall that in a Bayesian game, a pure strategy is a function $s_i:\Theta_i\to A_i$. "
1440,Purpose of a monotonic transformations in utility functions,"Utility is subjective, and as you wrote, ""it doesn't matter to us"", but only to the person who orders her choices. We are not able to quantify a subjective concept like the utility of another person, but each person can do this for herself.
This is the reason why utility is ordinal, which means that only the order of the numbers matters, and not the way we are measuring these numbers: if 10 > 3.123456, then the first bundle is preferred to the second one, by the person who orders her choices. And this ordering does not change if you change the units of measurement, and measure utility with square roots, exp, logs, (positive) power functions, etc. You can try to measure this in dollars if you want, you will never be able to measure utility."
1441,Why do you typically have to pay for use of the washing machines while other amenities are free?,"As you said, you would prefer to have free washing machines instead of free swimming pool. What does this mean? That washing your clothes is more important than having a bath in a swimming pool. Usually, it applies to almost anyone. So you could stop using swimming pool, but not washing machines."
1442,Soft Question: Economic measurement in a post-industrial economy,"Your friend is right that GDP and similar measures are flawed—or, at least, incomplete. But this isn't exactly news to economists!"
1443,Mixed strategy Nash equilibrium in 3x3 game,The general procedure to solve for a MSNE in a 3-by-3 (or larger) game is always a bit tricky and involves some trial and error
1444,The term “Most Favoured Nation” is misleading to me. Please explain,You seem to have it the wrong way around. 
1445,The Fed pays 1.50% interest on reserves; so why are interest rates so low?,There are several issues here:
1446,Ex-post vs Ex-ante Budget Balance in Auctions,These are widely used technical terms with a precise mathematical meaning:
1447,Modifying Hotelling's lemma: Is this valid?,You are basically on the right track but might have been carried away by not writing down function arguments. The profit function $\pi$ has arguments $p$ and $w$; don't drop them.
1448,Consumer behavior with constrained demand,"In a two-good space, initially the consumer maximizes $U(x,z)\;\; s.t. \;\;p_xx+p_zz =I$ and we assume it obtains the solution $(x^*, z^*)$ as a function of prices and income.  "
1449,conditional mean and conditional median,"In Alecos Papadopoulos's answer, both the conditional mean and the conditional median are linear in $X$. In the following example, the conditional mean is linear in $X$ while the conditional median is quadratic in $X$. This example is a constructed toy but it touches the heart of the issue."
1450,McCloskey's example of fungibility in basketball,"In economics and finance, fungibility means that we cannot distinguish between instruments. For example, we normally do not care whether we have one \$20 bill or two \$10 bills."
1451,What made The Wörgl Experiment successful?,It was successful because it combined three things at the same time.
1452,How is the ARIMA model a valid approach for forecasting Economic Variables?,"So your question is basically asking why a purely statistical model would be better at forecasting than a model based on theoretical relationships. For example, think about a simple form of the ARIMA model i.e. an AR model where you're just using lags of the process to explain the process itself. Now think about what is contained in the lags of the process... If the true process (i.e. the DGP) is determined by theoretical relationships between other variables then these will automatically be included in the lag. So the ARIMA model is a statistical way of modeling the process to make sure you capture the statistical properties of the underlying relationship but does not necessarily provide an explanation for what is going on. In forecasting, especially when series are volatile and erratic, you often find that simple statistical models such as these do a better job since the underlying relationships may not be very stable or may be more complicated than any theory we can come up with. This is related to a recent article  which you may find interesting: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207017300997"
1453,Is Artificial Intelligence a completely new (and underestimated) production factor?,"My guess is that it is not a new factor of production, but simply a type of total factor productivity. This is because:"
1454,Optimisation using value function,Starting with your original equation:
1455,"During deflation, is there any risk on 'printing' money?","You should be confused by Japan's version of QE. No one knows the long term implications, it has never been done before. "
1456,What level are EU tariffs mostly?,"To summarise crudely: the tariffs are punitive, to give all producers within the EEA as much of an advantage as the trade negotiators could deliver. And because the EEA represents a wealthy group of around half a billion consumers (very many of whom are not individually wealthy; but collectively are wealthy), the EU has huge negotiating power on trade agreements: probably about even with China and the USA, and superior to everyone else. So countries outside the EEA tend to get a poor deal in general."
1457,Notation of a Cobb-Douglas function printed in 1989,"Seems to be the second one, so $$ Q_t = A_t*(K_t^\alpha N^\beta_t T_t^\rho). $$"
1458,Why did the stock of consumer loans held by commercial banks jump in March 2010?,Because of a change in regulation about how different accounts are to be recorded. That change was stated in the Financial Accounting Statements No. 166.
1459,Why does falling global bond yields signal coming deflation?,Bond yields falling from their current near-zero position will place them in negative yield territory. Negative bond yields are deflationary by definition.
1460,Why Is Cointegration Important In Practice?,I think it is a very classical economic teaching problem - showing how something is relevant in the real world. 
1461,Does China subsidize its exports?,"World Trade Organization (WTO) rules prohibit export subsidies and China joined the WTO almost 15 years ago (in December 2001). As a condition of membership, China had to eliminate export subsidies in the late 90s. So, strictly speaking, China can't subsidize its exports. "
1462,Is a shrinking money supply environment painful for an economy?,"Money supply accounts for all the 'money' in circulation in the economy and the money itself has many forms. However, in a nutshell we can understand it as the flow of all kinds of monetary assets in the economy (broad sense of money). The correlation of money supply with growth has been quite contentious. We just lost a very good central bank governor in India because of these differences in opinion. The direction of causality is not so clear. However, many of the researches have had some empirical conclusions that suggest that GDP granger causes money supply and the vice versa is not true. "
1463,"What is the difference between Solow growth, classical growth, and neoclassical growth?","Classical growth theory: we can put many authors in it but I'd say Ricardo (if we put Malthus aside) is the first one to have describe a real growth theory. For their defenders, growth should somehow end at a certain point in time and is also very unstable for various reasons: Ricardo thinks growth would end because of diminishing returns (cf. Ricardo's On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation (1817)). In the classical growth theory, you can also include the theory of Harrod-Domar which basically explains that growth is unstable: there is either too much investment in comparaison to savings, or there is not enough investment (cf. Harrod's ""An Essay in Dynamic Theory"", The Economic Journal (1939)). "
1464,Where can I find information on relationships between different commodities?,"Quick answer, as I'm on my phone, but product by product input output tables can be obtained from Eurostat for EU countries, and are probably your best bet.  Individual countries may have more detail from their own National Statistical Institutes' websites."
1465,“Demand for money” - definition,Following on manofbear's answer. 
1466,What would be the economic impact of the “fair tax” plan?,"Well, one advantage to a sales tax is that it affects everyone (even those who don't pay income taxes). However, some people may see that same fact as a problem. This problem lies in analysis of the equity of the tax. When we consider every single person being taxed 30% on everything they buy, we need to think about how that affects different income groups. Lower income groups spend a much larger portion of their income on consumption, which means that they will be taxed relatively much more heavily than high income groups. This fact alone is enough to discourage this sort of action because the government tries to encourage saving in the lower income groups (so they can move up to higher income levels). This is one large reason why a tax like this may not be as fair as the name makes it seem."
1467,Is a hedonic regression a reduced-form?,"In the benchmark hedonic price analysis, we assume a utility function of the general form"
1468,What is the No Free Lunch Axiom?,"First, to give a little more background to 123's answer, a production set $Y$ is the set of all feasible production values. With $y \in Y$, $y$ is a vector in $\mathbb{R}^L$, where positive elements indicate outputs, negative values indicate inputs. The inputs you put in that get you outputs can be expressed with either a transformation or production function."
1469,Pareto curve vs Pareto chart,"The only relation I see is that they are both named after Vilfredo Pareto. The Pareto curve is related to efficiency, and I see no way of connecting the Pareto chart to the same concept. Since Pareto was an engineer before becoming an economist, it seems most likely to me that its just that two distinct techniques from two different fields were named after him. I suppose you could use a Pareto chart as a tool to make efficient engineering decisions, so they are minimally related."
1470,How does a positive capital shock cause an increase in land price?,"I think you got the answer, to give more detail: assume a Cobb-Dougblas production function: $Y=AL^{\alpha_1}N^{\alpha_2}K^{1-\alpha_1-\alpha_2}$.
The marginal product of land i.e. price is then:$$MPL = \alpha_1 A L^{\alpha_1-1}N^{\alpha_2}K^{1-\alpha_1-\alpha_2}$$
Simulate this model with various factor values. You can build the story yourself using this basic textbook explanation, don't need a paper for empirical evidence."
1471,How can the share price of a company be less than its (theoretical) liquidation value?,"A company can have a positive book value and still be in trouble because of insolvency.  This is very common with banks.  Banks operate by borrowing short term to buy long term assets.  This is inherently risky and vulnerable to a liquidity crisis.  A bank can show a profit and positive book value and still be in a world of trouble.  If investors feel that a bank will not be able to rollover their short term debt, then the bank will be in trouble.  Selling their long term assets will not be the answer because long term assets are by their very natural not very liquidable.  You can never trust a bank's balance sheet nor their income statement.  A more accurate assessment of a bank would be of their cashflow, maturity mismatching and credit rating."
1472,Is there a model for how much a philosopher produce in his lifespan?,Here is a somewhat creative (and very imprecise) answer:
1473,Lemma 2 in Tirole and Maskin's Dynamic Oligpoly I (1988),"The monotonicity result that they prove in their lemma 1 (p. 556) is stronger than you think: it states that whenever $q>q'$, the support of $R_1(q)$ is ""uniformly below"" the support of $R_1(q')$. In other words, it is impossible to find any realizations $(r,r')$ of $R_1(q)$ and $R_1(q')$, respectively such that $r>r'$."
1474,Why do government jobs provide better benefits than industry jobs?,I'll describe in turn five potential explainations:
1475,Separating and supporting hyperplane theorems,I will sketch a solution for your question on the separating hyperplane theorem together with one economic application to producer theory (for more details please look at MWG). 
1476,Examples of how economists come up with a production function for a firm?,"The ""production function"" in economics and econometrics is not an engineering concept. It is a highly abstract construction where the myriads of inputs used are lumped together in very few categories: ""capital"" and ""labor"" being the most usual ones, while sometimes inputs critical to an industry like say ""Energy"" may be singled out and appear in the production-function formulation. At such an abstract level, it is easily implementable without the need to go into particulars of each firm."

1478,Extensive form: backward induction & subgame perfect nash equilibria?,"Until the last paragraph your interpretation is correct.
$(a,d)$ is not a strategy profile, it is merely a 'history', a way that the game can play out. "
1479,"If banks started simply depositing money with each other, then what else?","The purpose of paying interest is to get people to lend you their money (by depositing it) so you can lend it out at a higher rate of interest. The argument here is that if the deposits outstrip the bank's ability to invest/lend, they don't need to offer as much interest to get those deposits. However, given current banking practice i don't think there is ever going to be more deposited funds than the bank can find profitable uses for, so the thought experiment sorta falls apart."
1480,Why does the definition of MRS follow from the implicit function theorem?,It's actually pretty straight forward. The implicit function theorem for two variables is given as follows (as long as some regularity conditions hold):
1481,"If $a$ and $b$ are two pure rationalizable strategies, can $0.5a+0.5b$ fail to be a rationalizable strategy?",Yes. Consider a two player game described by the following matrix
1482,GMM Estimation of a parameter from Intratemporal Euler of capital constraints,"To elaborate on what has been said in the comments already, using GMM based on Euler Equations generally involves uncertainty that motivates some sort of expected orthogonality between a moment equation and some instruments. Here is a common example of a ""Consumption-Based Asset-Pricing Model"" (see, for example, Campbell, 1993, 1996) posted by Dave Giles:"
1483,"Why does $\varepsilon_{x,p_x}^H =-s_y \sigma $?","First we need to define the elasticity of substitution $\sigma$. This can be a difficult and confusing concept. (If you want to have your mind blown, look at Table 2 in this survey by Stern, which classifies no fewer than 10 notions of the elasticity of substitution!). "
1484,VAR inversion - looking for a good resource,"To get Quah and Vahey's method, you should probably get a good handle on the Wold Representation Theorem first. Christiano has good notes on it here. Then, you can apply it to VAR. There's a pretty good basic explanation in Greene's Econometric Analysis. In the Sixth Edition, it's in Chapter 20 (Models with Lagged Variables) starting with Section 20.6, ""Vector Autoregressions."" It should be pretty straight forward to apply the Wold Theorem to VARs with Greene's notation. If it's still not quite clear to you, there's a pretty close example on page 704, subsection 20.6.8.b, ""The Sacrifice Ratio."" The basic idea is that you just end up sort of inverting the matrix of lag operators and coefficients (the ""inversion"" part) so that you have your main variable on the left side and a lag polynomial in your errors on the right side."
1485,Basic question: why do markets grow?,"The general answer is no, a closed market with only money circulating within the market, and that money never leaving it or entering it, cannot increase its aggregate price level - provided that the quantity of goods being sold on that market also remains constant. Price wise however, it can display variations over time, so share values can change - even if the money circulating that creates them doesn't."
1486,Solving for optimal consumption bundle,"Yes, you are correct. That solution implies a utility of $0$, while any other solution necessarily will give you negative utility."
1487,What are the most recent devopments with applying fractals to economics?,"Mandelbrot's original application to cotton prices, The Variation of Certain Speculative Prices, claimed that the price fluctuations followed a Lévy stable distribution with a stability parameter $\alpha$ below 2. ($\alpha=2$ corresponds to the normal distribution.)"

1490,Black-Litterman---in what way are expected returns hard to estimate?,"Your question relates more broadly to modern portfolio theory, and can be illustrated via mean-variance analysis of a univariate time-series. The extension to the multi variate (normal) setting, is trivial. Below I use the term accuracy, in a non-formal way, relating to the variance of an estimator. In particular, when the variance of an estimator can be reduced, take this to mean the estimator can be made more accurate."
1491,Benefits of a weak national currency,"It's usually considered a short term solution when you would rather do something quick than engage in structural reform. Economics consider this to be a very poor way of increasing competitiveness, since you're effectively harming the purchasing power of your own citizens. Let me explain."

1493,Do countries invest in the country's own stock market?,One example of monetary policy is the Bank of Japan buying the Nikkei as part of its asset purchasing program.
1494,Does elasticity vary along the Demand/Supply curve or is it a summary statistic of a curve?,"Yes, elasticity varies along a curve. No, elasticity is not a summary statistic of a curve."
1495,Name of example of irrationality of proportional and absolute cost,"I think you're referring to the jacket-calculator problem, first proposed by Tversky and Kahneman (1981) as their Problem 10. The paper illustrates the idea of mental accounting with several problems regarding uncertainty, and problem 10 illustrates ""the temporary devaluation of money"":"
1496,Price-consumption curve,"It's true that given the utility function the $y$-good is a normal good, so the question is quite odd. Ignoring this, your calculations are correct, but you could simplify to $y(p_x,p_y,b)=\frac{b}{2p_y-p_x}$."
1497,"Does RBC models pin down equilibrium output, amount of labor and capital without initial condition?","The stock of capital in the RBC model is a predetermined state variable, meaning that the capital $K_t$ available at time $t$ was determined at time $t-1$. Usually we have an accumulation relation of the form 
$$K_t = I_{t-1}+(1-\delta)K_{t-1}$$
When solving an RBC model starting at time $t=0$, we must exogenously assume some initial capital stock $K_0>0$ to get the model started, since we don't explicitly consider what happened at time $t=-1$."

1506,Static game with complete but imperfect information,"Complete information means every player has common knowledge of the structure of the game, in particular, everyone's preference over outcomes and the realization of the relevant state variables."
1507,Auctions with affiliation,"Roughly speaking, $X_1$ and $X_2$ are affiliated because they have the common component $T$. That is, if $X_1$ is large, $X_2$ tends to be large as well, because a large $X_1$ makes a large $T$ likelier than without this information.
The variables are affiliated if for the joint density $f_{X_1,X_2}$
$$f_{X_1,X_2} (x',y)  f_{X_1,X_2} (x,y') \geq f_{X_1,X_2} (x,y) f_{X_1,X_2} (x',y') \quad \forall x'\geq y, y'\geq y,$$

Firm 1's response to firm 2's and 3's quantity choices will satisfy the following:
\begin{eqnarray*} p(q_1 + q_2 + q_3) + p'(q_1 + q_2 + q_3)q_1 - c'(q_1) = 0 \end{eqnarray*}
Likewise, we'll get the implicit best response functions for the other firms as well. 
\begin{eqnarray*} p(q_1 + q_2 + q_3) + p'(q_1 + q_2 + q_3)q_i - c'(q_i) = 0 \end{eqnarray*}

1513,What types of 'market mechanisms' are said to exist besides auctions?,Other methods or mechanisms by which goods are traded in a market economy: 
1514,Inflationary recession vs Deflationary recession,"Deflationary recession refers to a recession in which prices are falling. An example was the Great Depression. Below you have a graph of the yearly rate of change in CPI. A negative number means a fall in prices, i.e. deflation. Shaded areas mean recession period according to NBER."
1515,Basic question on calculating real GDP,"First, note that GDP is not the quantities of all goods and services produced in that year multiplied by their prices in some base year, but the quantities of all final goods and services produced in that year multiplied by their prices.

has a fixed point, even though its range is not compact."
1517,To use seasonally adjusted data or not seasonally adjust data?,"There is a theoretical objection to using seasonally adjusted data, which I saw in an essay by Kalman (developer of the Kalman filter); sorry, I cannot find the reference. The argument is that seasonal adjustment is a filter, that has its own dynamics. You are then embedding these filter dynamics within the system that you are modelling. This would be a bad idea in engineering systems, but I am not entirely convinced it matters for economic systems. (My academic background is in engineering control systems.) However, if the variables you are forecasting exhibit roughly the same seasonal pattern, separately seasonally adjusting them might be problematic."
1518,Is there a natural intuitive interpretation of the **numerical value** of the coefficients of risk aversion?,"Yes, there is such an interpretation in Section 3 of the original paper by Pratt:"
1519,The Econometrics of the Stone Geary Production function,"Stone-Geary production functions attempt to reflect the real-world observation that for production to be feasible, there exist minimum thresholds in the quantities of inputs employed. This is not about initial investment but that one cannot use miniscule levels of inputs and obtain ""very little"" output -for production to even begin, one needs input amounts above a certain threshold, dictated usually by technology. At the aggregate (market or macro level), perhaps this effect practically vanishes, but for firm-level data, this may be an important feature of actual production.  "
1520,What's a good alternative to Romer's Advanced Macroeconomics?,"I like Introducing Advanced Macroeconomics: Growth and Business Cycles by Sorensen and Whitta-Jacobsen. The text provides intuitive explanation and exposition of models. The book is neither too mathy nor descriptive, I would say, they offer somewhat balanced introduction. "

1523,Economies of scale v.s. technological change,"The problem is to distinguish between changes along the production function, from $f(K_1, L_1)$ to $f(K_2, L_2)$, and changes of the production function, from $f(K_1, L_1)$ to $g(K_1, L_1)$."
1524,Deriving and using the pricing equation,"As regards the first question, the ""$p_t=...$"" expression is conceptually and qualitatively useful because, at the optimum, it relates price with consumption and expectations. Mathematically it is an implicit function of course, so it is not a ""closed-form solution"" to ""tell us how to find $p_t$"". "
1525,Textbook/Reading Suggestions for Urban Economics,"Masahisa Fujita is considered as one of the most famous theorist in urban economics. He is one of the pioneers of the New Economic Geography. His book 
Urban Economic Theory: Land Use and City Size, 1989, Cambridge is a master piece, laying down the theoretical foundations of urban economics. Also, you may read"
1526,Tools for Forcasting Unemployment Rate,I think one might use either vector auto-regression or perhaps factor-augmented vector auto-regression to make such predictions. The later will allow an economist to condition on hundreds of time series to predict future unemployment values without encountering the degrees-of-freedom issues that plague VAR whenever VAR attempts to condition on larger information sets. 
1527,Are there plausible scenarios for the U.S. dollar to fall out of use as the world's reserve currency?,"There are many plausible scenarios in which the dollar ceases to be the de-facto currency. They all have a few things in common. For people to stop using dollars for international trade, there would need to be two circumstances:"
1528,"If my IV (denoted Z) equals 1, my endogenous var D always equals 1; is this a problem?","Let $\hat{\pi}_0$ and $\hat{\pi}_1$ be the first stage coefficients. That is, $\hat{D} = \hat\pi_0 + \hat\pi_1 Z$. When $Z_i D_i = Z_i$ (if $Z_i=1$ then $D_i=1$), we can show that $\hat\pi_0 + \hat\pi_1 = 1$ always and $\hat\pi_0 = (\bar{D}-\bar{Z})/(1-\bar{Z})$. (Proof is fun.) Unless $\bar{D} \simeq 1$, $\hat\pi_0$ is far from unity, which means $\hat\pi_1$ is far from zero. Not a surprise that the p-value is very small."
1529,Do contemporary Marxist economists still deny the utility/value theory which underpins classical economics?,Conteporary Marxist economist Richard D Wolff says on the issue (abridged):
1530,How does the central bank changing interest rates change interest rates in the commerical banking sector?,"The federal fund rate is a cost for the commercial banks. They borrow at the federal fund rate and then they lend to the consumers.
The federal fund rate variation impacts the lending cost of the banks directly.
It's how it changes the interest rate charged by commercial banks."
1531,Why don't shipping businesses own their own shipping containers?,"First, it appears there are historical reasons: it was the initiative of the producers to standardize the way their goods were transported, already from the factory. And it involved transportation by rail initially, rather than ship. See interesting information here."
1532,Differentiating a conditional expectation: RBC models with uncertainty,"As I noted in a comment, to consider non-trivially a derivative, we must have a non-constant function in the first place. So, in generic terms, we are looking at the conditional expectation function $E(X\mid Z)$ and not at the conditional expected value of $X$ given a specific value $Z=  z$. "
1533,Constant Returns in a Production Function $\frac{Y}{L}=\left(\frac{K}{L}\right)^{\alpha}\left(\frac{R}{L}\right)^{\beta}$ ($R$ = Resource),"The purpose of the paper under consideration is to examine/show the ""investment rule"" that leads to ""intergenerational equity"", which with constant population translates into constant consumption. "
1534,Are there economic policies that help countries fight corruption?,"Kaushik Basu has proposed (Why, for a Class of Bribes, the Act of Giving a Bribe should  be Treated as Legal) legalizing paying bribes to separate the ties of criminality between the bribe payer and receiver. This allows the bribe payer to pay the bribe and report the bribe taker. If bribe paying is illegal then the shared criminality prevents this.  "
1535,What is the value of something?,"There is a lot to be said about this subject, and I will only give a partial insight."
1536,Which foreign workers in USA who send remittances to family are getting the best bang for their buck?,"A good start would be The Economics of Migrants' Remittances by Hillel Rapoport and Frédéric Docquier. They both work extensively on this topic. In this paper, they review the  theoretical  and  empirical  economic  literature  on  migrants' remittances."
1537,Does the Independence Axiom Require Statistical Independence?,First Question:
1538,"What's the difference between public debt, government debt and national debt?","With all these types of debt, there are various descriptions rather than standard definitions, and sometimes the same thing can be labelled with different names or the same name used for different things.  In addition, they can be measure gross or net, and there will be questions of how money owed by one part of the public sector to another is treated. "
1539,What Is the Economic Meaning of “Structural Reforms”,"Economic variables can be ""real"" or ""nominal"". So when policymaker discus influencing the economy, they look at implications of influencing these economic variables."
1540,Proving AC is minimized when MC=AC,You're making this way more complicated than it needs to be.
1541,Why does the European Central Bank use the 5y5y rate to measure inflation,To answer your question you have to understand Eurozone fixed income market structure:
1542,Transformation Function,"I'm sort of confused what you are asking, but the basic idea behind the transformation is that $y$ is a vector of inputs AND outputs for a firm. Things that are inputs are expressed in negative quantities. So when you are maximizing $\vec{p} \cdot \vec{y}$ for maximal profit, you are paying $p_1 y_1 + \cdots$ for the input(s), and gaining $p_n y_n + \cdots$ for the output(s)."
1543,"Why is government debt level presented as ratio to GDP, not against government budget or revenue size?","The ratio of government debt to GDP is a useful indicator because, broadly, the larger a country's GDP, the larger is the tax revenue the government could potentially raise to service the debt while maintaining other government expenditure at an acceptable level.  Thus a very high debt / GDP ratio would raise doubts about the government's ability to service the debt."
1544,Gali - Monetary Policy - Solutions?,"I don't believe that a solution manual to Gali's book has been written. In 2015 the book saw a second edition, so maybe this time around something will appear.
These course notes may be indirectly helpful to you. "
1545,What makes the Balance of Payments (BoP) to imbalance?,"In the IMF BPM6, BOP simply refers to a statistical statement (think of it as a piece of paper or an Excel spreadsheet) that records, in summary form, all of the country's international transactions. The BOP never refers to a number. Hence, there is no such thing as a BOP surplus or a BOP deficit. "
1546,What is the difference between VAT and corporate tax,"Both taxes take a cut from the difference between the income of a
  company and its expenses."
1547,Why are they raising interest rates in Brazil?,Brazil raising interest rates probably refers to the central bank raising their interest rate which means that it is more costly for banks to loan money from the government and therefore the amount of money in circulation (as per quantity theory) should go down. It is a policy decision (possibly wrong depending on who you ask) in a difficult economic situation where a country faces both inflation and a downturn.
1548,Is the standard of living of poor & middle class people higher than in the past?,"I think you are looking for data on real median incomes. If this concept is unknown to you, you can read about it on wikipedia."

1553,Bayesian vs. Frequentist Approach,"This is a more ""practical"" answer, vs a deeper theoretical one, or even a specific one. "
1554,Interpreting the ratio of two variances in a Bayesian decision problem,"Excuse the word-play, but the interpretation of $n'$ is a... posterior one. Meaning, the important thing is not how $n'$ is defined (ratio of variances, although this will prove consistent with the interpretation), but how it functions in the posterior mean and variance.  "
1555,Proof of nestedness of subgame perfect equilibria,"Perhaps I misunderstand something, maybe you do not allow mixed equilibria. That may be strange in games of imperfect information."
1556,Why does adding a quadratic term to a regression change unrelated coefficients?,"Your errors aren't the same anymore.  For example, instead of writing $Y = \beta_1 + \beta_2 X + U$, you're actually writing  $Y = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 X + \alpha_3 X^2 + V$.  There is no expectation that they should be the same."

1560,Why does the Fed control interest rates?,The fed controls interest rates via supply and demand. 
1561,How to determine regressive tax,"You're correct it is graph A. Regressive tax means that the lower income you have the higher %tax you have. If you imagine at the lowest level of income, you still have a flat tax(The intercept)."
1562,“Auction” versus “Bidding war”,"From a practical standpoint, bidding wars are effectively informal auctions. What is usually done is that the buyers inform their agents of their maximum price, and the buyers' agents tell the seller's agent ""This is my client's bid, but please let us know if we're outbid."" Sometimes this is formalized through what is known as an escalation clause, which is essentially an offer to bid some increment more than any other highest bid, up to some reservation price. "
1563,Do the number of days in a month affect monthly return? (seasonality),"It usually does not matter, at least in practical applications, because to compute monthly we usually take end of month closes. See the MSFT case:"

1566,What is the classic paper that derives borrowing constraints from asymmetric information?,"I don't know if you refer to the extensive margin (some borrowers not being able to get credit) or to the intensive margin (one borrower not being able to get as much credit as (s)he wants). If you are referring to the former, one of the theoretical papers for borrowing constraints on markets with asymmetric information is the following one:"
1567,Old Measure of Inflation Still Tracked?,"There have been several changes to the way the CPI is calculated over the years. A significant change occurred with respect to weights and hedonic adjustments in 1998 (I believe the pre-1998 series is what ShadowStats, without having any of the underlying data, attempts to replicate), and one in 1983 that, among other things, changed the way that housing services were calculated from an ""asset price"" approach to a ""rental equivalence"" approach. "

1569,"Why are CAD, AUD known as commodity currencies","From wikipedia: A commodity currency is a name given to currencies of countries which depend heavily on the export of certain raw materials for income. These countries are typically developing countries, e.g. countries like Burundi, Tanzania, Papua New Guinea; but also include developed countries like Canada and Australia."

1573,"If Americans drive more and consume more oil, why are cars less efficient?","The price of petrol / gasoline is surely a major reason, offsetting the effect of longer distances.  In many European countries it is more than twice as high as in the US, mainly because of differences in tax rates, as shown here. "
1574,Marginal buyer/seller as determinant of price,"If I have understood correctly, the question asks what should we know so that we can determine the wage using only information on the unconstrained workers. Here is a toy static model:  "
1575,Is money mostly created (out of nothing) by banks making loans?,"The monetary base (MB) contains what might be called ""public money creation"", Notes and coins in circulation (outside Federal Reserve Banks and the vaults of depository institutions), Notes and coins in bank vaults (vault cash), and Federal Reserve Bank credit (required reserves and excess reserves not physically present in banks). The broadest available government measured US monetary measure is M2, which does not contain all the elements of MB, but still is an approximation of the total of private and public money creation, which includes currency, plus time, savings, and demand deposit accounts. So, what is MB/M2? What fraction of money is created by the government of the total? "
1576,Empirical explanation on divergence between productivity and wages since the 70s,"This is sort of my field, tough I focus more on education. One explanation that seems to fit the data is that the american labor market now is incorporating benefits and variable pay, so wages should decouple from productivity if total compensation doesn't - and voi lá, that's whats happening."
1577,NE equilibrium with lobbying of cournot producers,"Since the choice of $q_i$ can be conditioned on $(s_i,s_j)$, strategies in this game are of the form $(\hat s_i, \hat q_i(s_i,s_j))$. For the given values $\alpha=3$ and $k=1$, the SPNE can be calculated as the profile where $s^*_i=1/3$ and $q^*_i\equiv 1$. Indeed, production levels $q_i^*=1$ are the unique NE in all subgames, independently of the chosen $s_i$-levels in the first stage. Therefore your suggested ""other SPNE"" is not an SPNE."
1578,How to perform unbalanced panel data regression in R?,"Here the solution would depend on what you want to accomplish. Note the problem is not just that the series is unbalanced, for an ordinary unbalanced panel data-set where firms have different number of $T$ observation the command would still work. Here no adjustments are necessary, you can easily try it yourself:"
1579,Computing pure strategy Nash equilibria in finite games,"If $10^{10}$ pure strategies is too large for Gambit, it'll likely be too large for any other software as well. In the comments, I suggested that you could first compute the expected payoffs for each player in a separate program such as Matlab/R/Excel, and then export the resulting matrix to Gambit where the BNEs can be calculated. This way, you may be able to save some resources for Gambit on converting the game into its Bayesian normal form. "

1581,When demand increases why does the price decrease but equilibrium price increase?,On a demand curve when the demand increases the price will decrease.

\left\{\begin{array}{cc}
v_2 & \text{ if } v_2 < 1 \\
5 & \text{ if } v_2 = 1.
\end{array}\right.
$$
Another, slightly more annoying equilibrium for $v_1,v_2 \in [0,1]$:
$$
\begin{align*}
b_1(v_1) & = 0 \\
b_2(v_2) & = 2.
\end{align*}

1583,Interpretation of the Cross Partials of the Cobb-Douglas,"The interpretation of the cross partial here is the change in the return (or marginal productivity) of labor when capital increases marginally. Similarly, it can be interpreted as the change in the return of capital, when labor increases marginally."
1584,Why don't we transact with securities rather than fiat money?,@EnergyNumbers aptly points out that Bearer bonds do exist and act in some way as a currency like you are describing. This does not answer the question of why aren't bearer bonds used instead of fiat currency?
1585,Can the function of the Central bank become automated?,"It is conceivable that one of the functions of a Central Bank, of being a regulator of money supply, could ultimately be automated, if artificial intelligence were to advance enough. However, that role is much more complicated than merely feedbacks on flow of money, inflation and fractional reserve. So for the foreseeable future, that's a role filled by a panel of human experts."
1586,Axiomatic Bargaining: Kalai-Smorodinsky and Nash solutions coincide,"Another sufficient condition for the two solutions to coincide, which is not necessarily the same as symmetry, is that the feasible set $S$ be rectangular. That is, 
\begin{equation}
S=\text{convex hull}\{(d_1,d_2),(d_1,\overline x_2),(\overline x_1,d_2),(\overline x_1,\overline x_2)\},

1598,How does the U.S agriculture subsidy not constitute export subsidies under the WTO?,"Certain types of agricultural subsidies are permitted under the WTO's Green Box. These include direct income support for farmers, and environmental and regional development programmes. However the rules state that, to qualify, such subsidies must be no more than minimally trade-distorting.  Whether such subsidies (in the US and other countries) actually meet that requirement is a matter of controversy, as discussed in this ICTSD Information Note which also shows (in Figure 1) the very high Green Box proportion of US subsidies.

1612,Source of commodity production statistics?,I work for Quandl and on our site I can recommend two free historical databases that you may want to check out: 
1613,Question on significance of different ways of measuring Price Elasticity of Demand,"Ideally the points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ are very close. The assumption is that that they are so close that the elasticity of the demand function on the curve between them is nearly constant. This is what elasticity is trying to measure, local changes, because on the far side of the range of the demand function consumer behavior may be unobserved and totally different. E.g. to my knowledge no one has tried to sell a bottle of Coke for \$40,000 so we don't know what value the demand function would take. If you would choose a very distant point $(x_3,y_3)$ instead of the local $(x_2,y_2)$ you would get a very different value of elasticity."
1614,Showing that the elasticity of arrival rate for workers wrt $\theta$ is between $0$ and $1$,"Let $m$ cobb-douglas. This means $m(u,v) = A u^\alpha v^{1-\alpha}$ for $\alpha < 1$ and $q(\theta) = A \theta^{-\alpha}$."
1615,Demand Curves for Stocks,"In a framework such as CAPM, agents are assumed to be rational, and usually to have identical preferences. All agents have access to the same information, and agree on the level of riskiness of every particular stock. As returns are a reward for taking risk, the price of every asset do not depend on the supply but on its riskiness. Thus, the demand curve is flat: no matter how much of asset A their is on the market, nobody wants to pay a premium which would lead to have a lower reward for a same level of risk."

1618,How to linearize the following difference equation?,We have the recurrence relation
1619,Monotone transformation of a game,"I interpret the question as follows:
Suppose we have a finite normal form game (with finitely many players and a finite set of actions for each outcomes). For simplicity, assume a strict ordering of payoffs for each player. That is, the payoff matrix of each player does not contain any identical elements."
1620,What happens to undated government stocks when interest rates dip below the coupon rate?,"This is a pretty standard bond pricing issue. The short answer is yes, the market value of the bond can and often will exceed its par value if interest rates are below the coupon rate, just so long as the call option is structured such that the government must pay any interest that has accrued between the last coupon date and the time that the call option is exercised. However, the extent to which the bond will pay more than its face is a question of how the call option is structured: whether it can be called at any time, or whether it can only be called on coupon dates."

1625,What utility functions are equivalent to additive functions?,Ted Bergstrom has Lecture Notes on Separable Preferences that seem to have what you are looking for. For example:
1626,First-price auction with discrete values,"The suggested pure strategies do not create an equilibrium, because if $X_2=X_1=2$, there is a tie. Whichever tie-breaking rule is employed, one of the players would want to deviate to $\beta_i=1+\epsilon$ to avoid the tie and win with certainty. If tie breaking is always in favor of the second player, player 1 deviates to $0+\epsilon$."
1627,How does the companies set up utility function for its own purposes?,"Most agents, including firms, do not actively set-up utility functions in their heads. A firm might however might have a worker create a profit function. A course related to labor economics will usually give you an idea of what sorts of things a firm considers."
1628,Empirical Data on Demand for Minimum-Wage Jobs in the USA,Neumark and Wascher have a paper that surveys recent empirical work on the effects of the minimum wage in detail. It includes a number of tables that nicely summarise the results of a large number (102!) of studies.
1629,How much of the Greece's public debt is created by its trade deficit?,"As an accounting identity, it is required that the current account surplus (deficit) +  capital account surplus (deficit) = 0. This is known as the balance of payments (BOP) identity . So if Greeks are importing more Euros worth of goods and services than they are exporting it must be that, consolidating across those outside of Greece, non-Greeks are buying more Euros worth of Greek assets than they are selling. "
1630,Workforce productivity,"The terms of art here for laziness like concepts are ""shirking"" and ""effort"", particularly  ""endogenous effort"" or ""variable effort"". You should also look into ""efficiency wages"". ""Free riding"" sometimes appears in this literature but because it is used heavily in the public goods literature it will have more false positives. "
1631,"In a competitive equilibrium, can price of a commodity ever be zero?",It depends on the assumptions you make.
1632,Who enjoys the Net Domestic Product?,"In terms of attribution. Recall that Net Domestic Product is the total cost of goods produced minus capital depreciation. In terms of why farmers income is lower, than the NDP, you must subtract out all the costs the farmers have to pay to create that good. So fertalizer cost, reinvestment, wages, interest costs, supplies, insurance etc. etc. all need to be subtracted. Finally, the remainder is split between farmers (in terms of income) and shareholder of corporations that operate in agriculture who recieve a return on thier investment (retained earnings for corporation or dividend payments). "
1633,Network goods in competitive markets vs. socially optimal network size,"There are two sorts of network effects a network good might have. It might have consumption externalities (such as with traffic) or it might have positive network externalities (such as with operating systems). The latter case is the case that your link discusses. I don't see a discussion of perfect competition in your link, but if you imagine a model in which consumers choose a level of some good with a positive network externality to buy at some price, equilibrium production should be less than socially optimal for the same reason that there is underproduction in perfect competition with any positive externality -- at the margin, consumers don't take into account the value buying the network good brings to other consumers.

With respect to symmetric preferences there are not really  pure symmetric ones in consumer theory at least, the only symmetric relation is total indifference ~ over the whole choice set. Clearly a ~b implies b ~a. A typical $\succeq$ preference relation is the union of an asymmetric and symmetric part. "

1639,What properties must a utility function have such that we can define level sets and thus indifference curves?,"Look take a rational preference $\succeq$ defined on X, endow X with some metric (thus a assume it is a metric space). Assume also X is separable (e.g. $\mathbb{R}^n$  satisfies this conditions but is more general). 
Now we let $\succeq$ be (i) rational (complete, transitive), (ii) continuous (it means that if $x^n\rightarrow x$ , $y^n\rightarrow y$ and $x^n \succeq y^n$ $\forall n$, then $x \succeq y$. Under this assumptions, then it can be represented by a continuous utility function. 
1. u is continuous by the above conditions. 
2. Curves in the level set are closed. It follows from the fact that the indifference relation is a closed set and the continuous utility representation: take $x^n  \sim  y\quad \forall n$ by continuity of the preferences $x \sim y$, now this implies that $u(x^n)$ is a sequence on the level curve $u(x^n)=u(y)$ for fixed y and by above $u(x)\rightarrow u(y)$ thus making it closed.
The other properties are deeper in the sense that one needs more assumptions, for instance to have the gradient of u it has to be differentiable, uniqueness of the extremum needs some sort of convexity of the level curves and so on.   "

"
1642,Why is the term structure curve of agricultural commodities often downward sloping?,"In Keynes's Treatise on Money he argued that the phenomenon you describe, known as ""normal backwardation"", is due to the fact that certain commodities producers hedge their price risk (importantly, they hedge their risk much more than consumers) by selling futures. The intuition for why the producer does this is that it allows the producer to lock in the price of the commodity in advance, allowing them to plan their production based on a guaranteed price. "

1644,Proving there exists no arbitrage opportunities given 3 states and 2 assets,"First, you are in fact given $p$. You can think of return as a security that costs 1 in current period and pays off $R$ in the next period. The price vector and the payoff matrix are thus
$$
p = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}, \  X = \begin{bmatrix} 1.1 & 1.0 & 0.9 \\ 1.0 & 1.0 & 1.0 \end{bmatrix}
$$ 
and we need to find positive vector $q$ of state prices such that $p = Xq$. Because the system is undetermined, there can be many such vectors, but as long as some of them are positive, we can be sure there's no arbitrage. To actually do the computation, one way would be to treat $q_3$ as a parameter, solve for $q_1, q_2$ as functions of $q_3$, then try to find $q_3 > 0$ such that implied values of $q_1,q_2$ are positive. But in this case it's easy to see that $q = (\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3})$ does the job."

1649,How do I construct the score process of a Markov model and verify that it is a Martingale?,"The derivation of the score process is correct. To verify that the process is a Martingale, recall the definition. It becomes clear that if we substitute $W_{t+1}$ back into the equation
$$
s_t(\theta \mid \textbf X) =
\begin{bmatrix}
 (1 - \beta_0) \sum_{j=1}^t W_j \\
 \sum_{j=1}^t W_j (X_{j-1} - \alpha_0)
\end{bmatrix}.
$$
Because $W_{t+1}$ are Normal with mean 0 and variance 1 (I'm assuming they're iid), then
$$
E[s_{t+1} \mid s_t ] = s_t + E \left [
\begin{matrix}
(1 - \beta_0) W_{t+1} \\
W_{t+1} (X_t - \alpha_0)

The idea is: each mutation of that species is ""programed"" to adopt a particular action (instinct), and when different mutations of the gene interact, it will generate probabilities of survival. Thus, an equilibrium strategy is an ESS, which are the types of actions instinctive to a certain gene type, which will tend to survive and procreate, passing forth the gene.

1686,How to find the present value of a perpetuity with a non-constant growth rate?,"Basically you want to calculate
$$
\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} a_t \cdot d^t
$$
where $d$ is the discount factor and where the value paid yearly increases linearly, that is
$$
a_t = a_0 + b \cdot t.
$$
With some rearrangements
$$
\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} a_t \cdot d^t = \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} a_0 \cdot d^t + \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} b \cdot t \cdot d^t.
$$
The first half of this is a simple geometric sequence like the present value of a perpetuity, so
$$
\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} a_0 \cdot d^t = \frac{a_0}{1-d}.
$$
To calculate the other sum we'll use a trick.
$$
\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} b \cdot t \cdot d^t = b \cdot \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} t \cdot d^t.
$$
Then write
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sum_{t=1}^{\infty} t\cdot d^{t} & = & d + 2\cdot d^2 + 3\cdot d^3 + 4\cdot d^4 + ...  
\end{eqnarray*}
You can rearrange this (because of absolute convergence) to
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sum_{t=1}^{\infty} t\cdot d^{t} & = & d + 1\cdot d^2 + 1\cdot d^3 + 1\cdot d^4 + ... \\
\\
& & \hskip 11pt + 1\cdot d^2 + 1\cdot d^3 + 1\cdot d^4 + ...\\
\\
& & \hskip 45pt + 1\cdot d^3 + 1\cdot d^4 + ... \\
\\
& & ...
\end{eqnarray*}
Every line in this is a geometric sequence, so
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sum_{t=1}^{\infty} t\cdot d^{t} & = & \hskip 7pt \frac{d}{1-d} \\
\\
& & + \frac{d^2}{1-d} \\
\\
& & + \frac{d^3}{1-d} \\
\\
& & ...
\end{eqnarray*}
Which is again a geometric sequence, thus
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sum_{t=1}^{\infty} t\cdot d^{t} & = & \frac{d}{(1-d)^2}.
\end{eqnarray*}
So
$$
\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} a_t \cdot d^t =
\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} a_0 \cdot d^t + \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} b \cdot t \cdot d^t =
\frac{a_0}{1-d} + \frac{b \cdot d}{(1-d)^2}.

For example, the technology necessary for congestion pricing of traffic is long established and indeed in use since the 1970's in Singapore. The existence of electronic transmitters or plate readers (London) may make for finer gradations of pricing and simpler administration but haven't made for widespread adoption. In fact, many notably congested larger cities like New York and Hong Kong have had failed congestion charge proposals. Or take a crowded national park. If ticket prices at Yellowstone were \$115 per person like Disney World instead of the nominal \$30 per car they actually charge it wouldn't be nearly as crowded. Prices are well below the market clearing rate as a matter of public policy, not because there is a technological obstacle to charging more. "

For example, from 1934 until 1971 the US government would exchange \$1 for 1/35th of an ounce of gold. "
1732,Why are asset pricing models equilibrium models?,An equilibrium asset pricing model is one in which the asset prices jointly satisfy the requirement that the quantities of each asset supplied and the quantities demanded must be equal at that price. It is as opposed to a partial equilibrium model where the price of the asset (or at least some assets) are determined outside of the model.

For simplicity, we use logarithms for the rates of change of its determinants
\begin{equation}
ln(Q)=\alpha ln(K)+(1-\alpha)ln(L)

1734,"Real Positive Eigenvalue, but Stable Dynamics","If you have are trying to discretize the continuous time model
$$
\dot{\textbf{x}} = A\textbf{x},

then in discrete time you will have
$$
\textbf{x}_{t+1} = B \textbf{x}_t
$$
but $A\neq B$, since $A$ describes the change in $\textbf{x}$ while $B$ describes the next value of $\textbf{x}$, not just the change. However
$$
\Delta\textbf{x}_t = \textbf{x}_{t+1} - \textbf{x}_t = B \textbf{x}_t - \textbf{x}_t = (B-I) \textbf{x}_t

This new matrix $B-I$ would correspond to $A$."

1738,Why is food less expensive in India than the United States?,"I think your intuition is right that food is cheap there. The Economist Big Mac price index suggests that India has some of the cheapest big macs in the world. More generally, the index indicates that there is a strong relationship between GDP per capita (a proxy for labor costs) and Big Mac prices:

So there are recent cases which illustrate what happens."
1742,Random Choice interpretation,"I don't feel these two interpretations are mutually exclusive, they belong to different sides of the same problem - one is empirical the other is theoretical. The conflict you seem to see between these two methods is that the ""population"" interpretation is individual specific. But the population component is a statistical convenience. It is ""everything else"" that the researcher has no time to model, and it is variation on the level of the population of observations not people - so it is not an individual specific error. "
1743,How to approximate stochastic volatility model with finite-state Markov chain?,You could do a binomial-tree approximation to the process for $z_t$ and then have a different process control the number of steps you take on the tree.

(...) In this case GBP was mostly accepted for trade in Ireland, while IEP was rarely accepted in the UK. Would GBP be in the IEP money supply, but the IEP not in the GBP?"
1750,What is the difference between a perfect foresight equilibrium and a rational expections equilibrium?,"This is not a formal definition, but a useful piece of intuition. I  think that the best way to think about it is that when there is uncertainty in a model it arises mainly in two forms either there is information that some agents have, but not every agent has it (private information), or there are truly random events that no one knows (in game theory jargon, these are moves by nature). "
1751,Existence of market sharing equilibrium in hotelling model,Market sharing simply means that both platforms have some market share. So the condition can probably be obtained by finding the closed-form solution for market shares (not only implicitly as in (7)) and imposing the condition that all market shares are positive. This is akin to each platform having an interior solution.

 1). Because the employees tend to be VERY good at what they do, thus their opportunities are vast; and people tend to gravitate towards who pays the most.
 2). Stress. 
 3). Contracts. Many employees in these big firms tend to only have short term contracts for specific projects. 
 4). These companies demand some of the best talent and work, and if an employee isn't reaching par consistently, no reason to keep them.
I'm sure there are more reasons, but those are researchable. =-) "

will hold. (Or you can also use the general form of your equations (1),(2),(5) and (6) to get this.) Given your particular production functions the marginal rates of technical substitution are
$$
\begin{align*}
|MRTS_c(K_c,L_c)| & = \frac{L_c}{K_c} \\
\\
|MRTS_w(K_w,L_w)| & = \frac{L_w}{K_w}.

Taken together, this means
$$
\frac{L_c}{K_c} = r/w = \frac{L_w}{K_w}.
$$
It follows that
$$
L_c + L_w = (K_c + K_w) \cdot r/w.

Then, for any concave increasing $u$, we'll have $$\int udG \geq \int udH$$ This would correspond to Aigner and Cain, where the risk averse firm would prefer to hire an agent from distribution G. "
1772,Confusion about the effect of an increased expected inflation on the price level,"From what I understand, everything here has been expressed in real terms. With the announcement, people now expect higher money growth and 'higher inflation'. True that the nominal interest rate rises, they earn greater return on savings, yet it is of no use to them if price level rises. Note that, here, only real rise in interest rate would induce people to save more. Thus now, according to the author, consumption tends to rise and how that might lead to rise in price level is clear."

When Congress decided to do mass electrification they guaranteed generation and sales monopolies but required firms to sell off all non-generation related businesses.  The primary buyers of the trolly systems were the automotive makers, who immediately shut them down."

1788,Effects of price transparency,"I will expand this into an answer since I've had a chance to look at a bit more of the literature on price salience, which I consider to the primary consideration here. That being said, I think there is something to say about the fact that the company might do away with a pricing policy that some subset of potential customers feels is deceptive. This will obviously lead to a more positive perception of the company (from these customer types). Whether or not this positive increase can offset the impact of increased price salience is an open question. "
1789,"How do I best prevent cheating using a credible threat in a two-person, non-cooperative, positive sum game?","There aren't two payoff matrices. If there's a random choice between the two payoff matrices, then the overall payoff matrix will just be a linear combination of the two matrices you've presented, according to the probabilities. For instance, if the probability of getting caught is 10%, then each entry in the overall matrix is .9 times the corresponding entry in the first matrix, plus .1 times the entry in the second matrix. Since the two matrices are identical but for the bottom right, only that square will depend on the probability. If the probability of getting caught is $p$, then the payoff in that square will be $4(1-2p)$. More generally, if they have probability $p$ of getting a fine $f$ instead of the regular payoff, then the overall payoff will be $4(1-p)-pf=4-4p-pf=4-(f+4)p$. As you say, a higher probability of getting caught means less of a fine is required, and vice versa."
1790,What's the difference between Quantitative Easing and regular central bank operations?,"In usual open market operations, the central bank will create money, use this money to buy short term Treasury securities from maybe banks, individuals, institutions in the open market. This creates more demand for these securities. Hence their price goes up and yield goes down. This newly generated money goes into the banking system. With more money, banks have more cash and have more reserves. With more reserves banks may be more willing to lend to each other and to individuals also. This lowers the short term inter banking interest rate. This way, there is more money in the system and there is a downward pressure on rates. With short term Treasuries, central bank is less exposed to the interest rate risk. "
1791,Why has Apple increased app store prices in the UK?,"Since payments to app developers are denominated in USD it does make sense to raise prices. The pound sterling has decreased in value relative to the USD by about 30 percent since May 2014, which I'm selecting as the arbitrary peak for comparison. So if they kept the same prices as before the recent slide, an app would make about 30% less relative to 2014. Even relative to Jan of 2016, the app would make about 14% less in USD. "

1796,Rising Marginal Costs: where is the empirical evidence?,"Based on data/work with consultants/business school discussions with executives: A good example of a set of industries where marginal costs are rising is commodity production (metals, agricultural products, and energy such as oil). In such industries, companies own many plants (Glencore, BHP Billiton) and they tend to switch on production in a plant when the price is above the marginal cost of that plant. So it makes sense to order plants in increasing order of their marginal cost, and assume that the lowest-marginal-cost plant will be the last one to be shut down. Of course if the firm acquires a plant that has a lower marginal cost than the lowest-marginal-cost plant, it will shift that firm's marginal cost curve. Look for Carmin Nappi's slides online on the aluminum industry, plenty of that analysis going on."

1798,Extraction and royalty time path for a non-renewable resource under a monopolist assumption,I would say that (a) follows from a downward sloping demand curve that causes marginal revenue to decline faster than price. As you write a monopolist accounts for that and to maximize profits thus extracts less to drive up the price. That also explains why generally exploitation would take longer. 
1799,What are the factors that drive openness in developed vs developing countries,"I assume you mean openness to international trade, and that you're interested in both policy choices (does the country want to be open) and physical constraints (can they be open).

1802,When shall I use bootstrap standard error?,"Normally, you use bootstrapping when you cannot derive a formula for the variance-covariance matrix of your estimator. Since you do not have this formula, you cannot obtain the standard errors of parameters, and so your econometric analysis is very limited. In these cases, using bootstrapping is the only option available. This is common in complex, non-linear models."
1803,Sen's Liberal Paradox,"Another solution can arise if you allow for uncertainty and for the planner to provide private information to each player. See Bergemann and Morris, 2018 for a survey in what is called information design. In that way, it is not hard to see how each player can be convinced that the social allocation is its most preferred outcome with high probability such that from the ex-ante perspective, the outcome is Pareto-optimal. "
1804,Is market failure the same allocative inefficiency?,"In this context 'market' usually means some allocation mechanism. For example free market, or a market where someone has monopoly power. Allocation of goods and resources can be done in other ways: e.g. you can divide all resources evenly among production processes and all goods evenly between consumers. This will generally result in allocative inefficiency (were all production processes equally important and efficient?). But it is not market failure because there was no market, just an allocator/social planner."
1805,How does low population growth increase the effect of accumulated wealth,"Piketty's essential argument is that when the $r$ is the rate of return to wealth and $g$ is the economic growth rate, you will see wealth and economic power concentrate in the hands of the few when $r \gt g$. This presumes that the wealthy will reinvest their returns from wealth rather then spending it on consumption. "

Canada was experiencing wildfires which shut down oil production, Nigeria suffered from attacks in the Niger Delta (the main source of Nigerian oil), and Venezuela was experiencing severe political crisis. With a supply decrease, oil prices were bid up."

It's the idea that a country can only have up to two of the following: free capital flow, a fixed exchange rate, and independent monetary policy. Right now it seems that Venezuela wants a stable currency exchange (so they control it) and they want reserve currency available to stabilize the economy if need be and have independent monetary policy."
1812,Subsidies Incidence on Producers and Consumers,"According to standard textbooks on public finance (e.g., Tresch, Public Finance, 3rd ed., p. 272) the tax incidence includes the deadweight loss. This is because we are interested in the burden of the tax on consumers and producers and the deadweight loss can be a large part of this. (However, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_incidence which does not include the deadweight loss.)"
1813,Price Producers Receive as a Result of Indirect Taxes,"The idea is that both the consumer and the producer of a good take on some of the burden of a tax, even if you don't intend to levy the tax on one or the other. So if you have a sales tax that consumers have to pay, what will happen is that consumers won't take the full brunt of that tax. They will demand less and producers will have to make the product cheaper in response, so they get less revenue overall anyway."

1817,Why does a currency devaluation make a country more attractive for foreign direct investment?,A depreciation in the Yuan will result in an increase of Chinese exports as where countries compete on price for goods like steel and tires the demand is very elastic. A small change in price will lead to a large shift in the quantity demanded. India knows this and after a succession of poor last few months exports will stand to lose out even more now that the Yuan has devalued. 
1818,Why is the Fed considering increasing interest rates?,"The Fed recently decided not to raise rates because the economy is still recovering.  In theory, as unemployment goes down, it should start to increase inflation.  However, unemployment is low and inflation is also low.  This is probably because people have left the labor force and are no longer counted.  Having low interest rates does stimulate the economy but the Fed wants to raise rates, when possible, for several reasons.  Policy is supposed to be countercyclical so keeping low interest rates indefinitely could lead to inflation.  Also, low interest rates encourage investors to pursue more risky investments for higher yields which can cause bubbles and crashes.  Also, staying at low interest rates limits the Fed's ability to use monetary policy at the zero-lower-bound where they cannot stimulate the economy anymore by using conventional monetary policy."
1819,Are savings necessary for economic growth?,Your intuition is correct. With 0 savings there could be not only no economic growth but no economic activity assuming depreciation exists.

1822,How does the Uber's pricing model work?,"It is important to distinguish between optimal pricing from Uber's perspective and optimal pricing from an efficiency standpoint. If Uber was the only company matching drivers and customers, it would adopt a monopoly pricing strategy on selling rides to consumers and buying rides from drivers. These rates may be very far from the efficient rates. It is therefore important to state what you mean by a ""better"" pricing model."
1823,What economics aggregate(s) could suggest an imminent change in exchange rates?,"If they expected the peg to break then it is clear that the franc would gain in value. Since the currency has been held artifically cheap by the central bank, i.e. would have gained value if the central bank had not intervened, then the moment the central bank stops intervening (abandons the peg) the currency will appreciate."

The model is a binary non parametric regression. 
I don't know of a general model, I know of a semiparametric model by Klein and Spady 
http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/718/NonParametrics7.pdf
The model is as follows let $x´=[x_1´ \quad x_2´]$ 
Now $P(y=1|x)=E[y=1|x]=g(x'\beta)=f(x)$. 
The details in the link. 
Another possibility is to estimate the joint distribution (that has both discrete and continuous variables). Let g(y,x) be the joint pdf, then estimate $g(y|x)=\frac{g(y,x)}{g(x)}=f(x)$. The estimation of a joint of this type needs a product kernel that you can check

This is under the assumption that investors are free to choose between investing consecutively in x number of short term bonds and one long term bond for x number of periods (e.g. buying five one-year bonds consecutively and buying one five-year bond). This assumption results in the term interest rates being equal to the expected average overnight rate to its maturity."

Obviously, some categories will map well at low granularity (UCC 190903 will definitely map to 722, for example). "
1832,Reasons for the recent rise in long-term unemployment,"I would ""advise"" to wait... a few more years! From the figure you provided, there is a perhaps slow but visible rising trend (with business-cycles-like ""seasonality"") for both the long-term and the mid-term unemployment rate, a fairly stable trend in terms of steepness over 60 years. The sudden peak of long term unemployment in 2009 is impressive but it also fell sharply in the next three years. To me, it appears critical to know the unemployment rates for the next four-five years, in order to decide whether we have a structural break with the historical rising trend becoming more steep, or just a few-years-incident due to the crisis."

$$

$$
holds for all $x$. Thus, we must have $D' + H'(A - I) = 0$ and, consequently,
$H' = D'(I-A)^{-1}$. This implies that $\eta = (F' + H'B)'(F' + H'B)$. "

1865,Effects of ACA individual mandate vs AHCA surcharge,"Working off of Josh's answer let's do a case study based on a real world example. On Friday, before leaving for a 7 day cruise through the eastern Caribbean, I went to the Dr and got a prescription for Tramadol, a pain reliever to treat an injury. I went to all of the usual suspects, Walgreens, CVS, etc, and found that with my insurance, the cost for 15 50mg pills was 60 dollars. Using the app GoodRX, I was able to reduce this cost to 44 dollars. I decided to pass. Fast forward two days to find me sunning in the Dominican Republic but unable to enjoy myself because of the injury so I found the nearest pharmacy and was able to purchase a blister-pack of 20 50mg pills for 13 US  dollars without a prescription (Tramadol is not regulated like a narcotic as it is in America). These were not knock-offs but the actual meds. How could this be, I wondered. So I asked the pharmacist. He told me that drug manufacturers make all of their profits in America, marking up the same drugs that sell in other countries for reasonable prices to exorbitant prices and then offer modest discounts to insurers, not to mention the profits of the pharmacy. Why can one script be 90 bucks at Walgreens and only 4 bucks at Walmart?  The simple answer is greed and slothfulness. Drug companies and pharmacies rely upon the laziness of Americans and our willingness to get screwed and our eagerness to bitch about problems without the slightest intent on fixing them. "

1868,Is the labor force participation rate related more to labour supply or to labour demand? Or both?,"It's both but if one is ""more correct"" then it would be labor supply. In an economics sense, just to be clear here, during the Great Recession the labor force PR didn't contract because of ""employers were not willing to hire workers"" per se. The labor force includes those currently employed and those not working but are actively looking for work. So it's as unemployed workers become discouraged and stop trying to look for work that the labor force contracted.
Then on the demand side consider someone receiving a form of govt benefits (food stamps, cash asst., unemployment benefits) for instance. 
If they receive 400USD wk and have the opportunity to work 20hr/wk at 8USD (so 160USD/wk) and are subject to a benefit reduction rate of 100%---meaning that for every 1USD they earn, they lose 1USD in benefits---they aren't likely to take that job as they are basically working for nothing for the first 400USD.

Calling them ""transactional (dis)utility"" would not fit in this context."
1882,"If Trickle Down Economics Works, Then Shouldn't “Trickle Up” Economics Work as Well?","In Keynesian economics, yes, it can work the other way around - in fact, it may even be more effective. I don't have any textbooks or sources handy, but in general, people with lower incomes have a higher marginal propensity to consume. That is, if you give a poor person an extra dollar, they will spend more of that dollar, and save less of it, than someone who is wealthier. Since more of the additional money is spent, the tax cut will have more of a stimulative effect on the economy. In Keynesian terms, the fiscal multiplier will be larger."
1883,Why are there estate taxes after the owner passes away?,"From an equality of opportunity perspective, it is desirable to have some taxes on inheritance. This levels the playing field for each generation to some extent. If real estates are exempt from such a tax, individuals would prefer real estate over other assets, creating a distortion in the asset price market."
1884,Why bankrupt firms continue to operate?,Declaring bankruptcy is a way to prevent creditors from seizing assets and pursuing lawsuits to recover what they are owed in a piecemeal fashion. It forces all parties to wait for a judgement that determines in what fashion various classes of creditors will be repaid.

Well, it does. That's exactly what public investment & spending, and the taxation system, do. The government creates money, puts it out into the economy, and collects it back through taxation and other payments."

1908,Does decreasing marginal utility imply risk aversion?,"What you are misunderstanding, is that in  expected utility theory, marginal utility is not an independent concept from ""risk aversion"", as the latter is defined in the context of that theory: ""risk aversion"" does not mean what it means in everyday language. Being ""risk averse"" does not mean for the theory ""I dislike risk"", because taken literally ""disliking risk"" would imply that ""risk"" is a separate entity, or an aspect of a situation, which produces negative utility.

u(\theta) & = \theta q(\theta)-t(\theta) \\
\\
u(\theta + \delta) & = (\theta + \delta) q(\theta + \delta)-t(\theta + \delta)

$$
By incentive compatibility (where $\theta + \delta$ is the true type, $\theta$ is the false type) we have
$$
u(\theta + \delta) \geq (\theta + \delta) q(\theta)-t(\theta)
$$
Using these (I used square brackets for clearer notation, there is no mathematical function to them)
$$
\begin{align*}
u(\theta + \delta) - u(\theta) & =
\left[(\theta + \delta) q(\theta + \delta)-t(\theta + \delta)\right] -
\left[\theta q(\theta)-t(\theta)\right]  \\
\\
u(\theta + \delta) - u(\theta) & \geq

1913,Solving a maximization problem by substitution when the constraint is in implicit form,"Here are two methods. First method: the substitution can be made by inverting $f$. Since $f$ is strictly increasing and continuous, $f^{-1}$ is well-defined. The constraint can therefore be written
\begin{equation*}
x = f^{-1}\Big(\dfrac{c-(1-P)f(y)}{P}\Big)
\end{equation*}"
1914,Is non-monotonic local non-satiation supported by consumer theory in economics?,"Suppose we're talking about some bundle of consumables, $x$. If preferences are monotone, either weakly or strongly, the general idea is that more is better. With local non-satiation the idea is that, no matter what $x$ you have, there is always some small change in $x$ that would make you better off."
1915,Does a price on the demand curve represent the highest or lowest price the consumer is willing to pay?,"I am perfectly willing to pay nothing to take a taxi ride in NY. If I were have to pay, I am willing to pay no more than \$5 for such ride. Therefore, I am not willing to pay \$10 for such a ride. "
1916,Why doesn't the price of gold drop as mining occurs that produces more gold?,You cannot reason directly from a price change. Prices may increase because supply has fallen or demand has changed. In general we can't distinguish between the two unless we know something about the demand and supply curve in particular and not just prices and quantities. 
1917,Will China's GDP be greater than the USA's and Europe's combined?,Of course this is is possible. China is a very large economy currently and it is likely quite a way away from reaching its production frontier. It has lots of room to grow.
1918,How much average value does 1 working hour produce? ( are there reliable statistics?),"That is a great question.  And it depends (famous economics response to anything).
Here are some of the factors on, “how much does 1 hour of work produces”:

1934,Why is the yen getting stronger even with negative interest rates?,"Negative interest rates are not incompatible with appreciation of the local currency. As pointed out by the economist (Why investors buy bonds with negative yields), some investors buy bonds to place bets on currencies. Thus, it does not matter so much that the interest rate is negative."
1935,Is economic growth measured in real GDP or in real GDP per capita?,"Usually GDP growth rates are publicly talked about in real terms but not per capita, see for example World Bank where, above the relevant table we read"
1936,By what steps and contracts does new money enter the economic system?,"The phrasing of your question (the same is true for your description of your understanding) suggests to me that what you need to understand about money creation in banking is much more basic than ""steps and contracts"". As a full treatment of money creation would not be appropriate on a Q&A site (it'd be really long!), I will instead recommend that you first read about the different types of money (specifically, the difference between base money and broad money), and then that you read ""Money Creation in the Modern Economy"", which will answer your question about how banks create money. "
1937,Indifferent choice assumption in economics,"Because otherwise you would not have subgame perfect equilibria. Suppose I have an item you need and the item is worthless to me. I would be happy to give you the item for any positive amount of money. If you give me no money for it, I am indifferent, both giving you the item and not giving you the item is an optimal choice for me. Just to be clear: we are not bargaining. You set I price and I will take it or leave it. "
1938,Why doesn't Costco simply raise prices and nix the membership fee?,I agree with @Alecos Papadopoulos that this is probably a marketing/product differentiation trick. You attract a specific type of consumers with a specific mindset.
1939,"Large consumer goods companies not using advertising, and what their reasons are","I'd argue that the best example is Jiffy Mix, which spends literally no money on advertising, even in the form of the implicit advertising fees paid to direct marketing affiliates.

1941,Is this non-separable utility?,"You are right, these preferences are separable. A way to see it is to notice that
\begin{equation*}
U(c,n) \geq U(c',n) \Rightarrow U(c,n') \geq U(c',n')

for any $n,n'$, and 
\begin{equation*}
U(c,n) \geq U(c,n') \Rightarrow U(c',n) \geq U(c',n')

for any $c,c'$.
They are even additively separable, as your log-transformation shows."
1942,“Printing” money to build housing,"This is a partial answer, in the sense that it addresses the case for state-sponsored house building, rather than the question of how that should be financed. In general, any means by which the state might finance spending is likely to introduce some kind of distortion into the economy. The question then faced is whether that spending generates benefits sufficient to offset the cost of the distortion."
1943,Does concavity of the utility function has any bite?,"This post shows clearly why in the world of ""standard"" ordinal utility, concavity of a utility function cannot obtain an economically meaningful interpretation, although it may be useful as a mathematical property."

1951,Was Haiti the richest society in the world in the late 18th century?,"It has certainly been argued in various places that Haiti was the ""richest"" colony.  It's obviously difficult to reconstruct modern measures of wealth such as per capita income for historical territories, and the metric of ""rich"" that mattered in the day was how much revenue could be extracted by the colonial government, so assessments may be skewed towards this.  My books are boxed at the moment, but this is what I could find based on the footnotes from Understanding Power (ch 10 p62)."

1963,Causal effect of population growth on GDP per capita increase,"Birth rate affects not only total population but also the age structure of the population.  If the birth rate over many years is below the level at which the population replaces itself, the result will be a falling population with an increasing proportion of elderly and often economically inactive people.  With a falling proportion of economically active people, GDP per capita is likely to be less than it would have been with a higher birth rate.  "

1965,what is consumer surplus practically?,"It is better to think of it as a ""saving"" rather than as a""surplus"".
Also, it is better understood if we imagine heterogeneous consumers for whom a threshold price exists, a ""maximum willingness to pay"". Then at  a given price level, some consumers are willing to buy the product and are expressing their demand for the product, while others are out of the market, because the price is still above their maximum willingness to pay. "
1966,Is there a game that cannot be represented by a game tree?,"Well, for this you need to define what a ""finite game"" is. The usual way to do so, is to define it as an extensive form game, which makes the whole issue circular. But there are different ways to model extensive form games at different levels of generality. For example, the first definition due to John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern made a number of strong restrictions on timing that look somewhat archaic from today's perspective. The subsequent definition by Harold Kuhn significantly generalized the class of possible extensive form games. An implicit restriction in the way Kuhn defined extensive form games was that no player is allowed to move through the same information set twice, an assumption weakened in the Ph.D. thesis of John Isbell. So there are various notions of extensive form games at various levels of generality, including versions that allow for infinite games."
1967,Budget hyperplane in n dimensions,"Let matrix $A = \begin{bmatrix} p_1 & p_2 & \ldots & p_n \end{bmatrix}$. Let $\mathbf{x}^*$ be a fixed solution to $A \mathbf{x} = c$. Then for any vector $\mathbf{u}$ that belongs to the null space of $A$, we have $A \mathbf{u} = 0$ hence $\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{x}^* + \mathbf{u}$ is also a solution (furthermore, all solutions $\mathbf{x}$ can be written this way). The dimension of the set of solutions to $A\mathbf{x} = c$ is thus the dimension of the null space of $A$."

1971,How can all the bitcoin in the world be worth more than McDonald's Corporation?,Bitcoin doesn't have a value. It doesn't create wealth - it destroys it. It therefore has no yield.
1972,How do countries create their own currencies (and give them meaningful value)?,Money is something which has value because everyone believes it has value. 
1973,What exactly is the argument for Free Trade?,"The theory behind free trade is denominated comparative advantage, and as mike stated, the advantage is that a country, as a whole, benefits from specializing in the fields at which it is best, as it will get more than it would if it would produce everything alone."
1974,LIBOR rates: Are these monthly or yearly interest rates?,"To answer the first part, it's an ""annualised"" interest rate convention - like all other quoted interest rates. For example, if a one-month money market rates are unchanged at 4%, you would receive approximately 4% in interest after a year, or roughly 1/3% a month. (Note that those numbers are ignoring compounding, further details below.)"
1975,Whatever happened to Henry George's ideas?,"Henry George's economic theories and politics were influential enough around the turn of the last century to attract a significant number of opponents, who had vested interests in land speculation and rent-seeking in general.  As such, they promoted an alternate formulation of economic theory that reduced/ignored the role of land as one of the primary factors of production.  Most modern economic theory has been built on this new foundation, even though the original (largely political) reasons for doing so have long since been forgotten.  So nowadays you find extremely convoluted definitions of ""economic rent"" that attempt to ignore the role of land, and conflation of George's ideas with communism or socialism or other inappropriate connections."
1976,What is “inter-temporal smoothing”?,"Intertemporal consumption smoothing is using savings or borrowing to make consumption less volatile than income (or sometimes wealth). The intertemporal consumption smoothing  motive can arise in many settings, but an early and famous example is the Milton Friedman’s permanent income hypothesis. The idea is that if income contains permanent and temporary shocks then maximizing the NPV of lifetime utility will make you ignore temporary shocks and consume a fixed fraction of your permanent income.

Adopting another country's currency means that you trade your ability to make decisions about your country's quantity of money, inflation target, etc. to a tested and solid mean of payment (the advantages you listed are good reasons)."
1982,Inflation basics and understanding,"The grey-haired ""Quantity Theory of Money"" is a good initial way to gain some clear understanding for inflation. This theory is just one equation,"
1983,"Hypothetical: If a nation produces absolutely no good or service, would the currency notes it has have any value?","No, because people could still find value in the notes. For example, let's say the nation had the most transparent and hard-lined central bank in existence. Then, people of other countries might find the notes worthy."
1984,"Why do housing and parking cost more in urban than in rural areas, but road access doesn't?","Land values tend to increase with population density, because it is typically possible to put the land to more productive use.  A store operating in a dense urban core will have more potential customers, more access to public infrastructure (e.g. electricity, communications networks, those roads you mention, public transportation that makes it easier for more customers to visit the store, etc.) and any number of other external factors that contribute to such land being more desirable.  Since more high-wage jobs also tend to be available in such places, there is more access to desirable public and private places (e.g. museums, theaters, upscale businesses) people are also generally willing to pay more to live in such places."
1985,Will a Free Software Society ever become a reality?,Your questions asks:

1989,What exactly is L in a Cobb-Douglas production function?,"It can be both. The number of working hours are of course easier to interpret. You can also make the assumption that every employee works some fixed number of hours, say 8 per day (or 220 per month, or 38 a week, etc). In this case if you denote by $n$ the number of workers and $L$ the number of hours worked you have of course
$$
n \cdot 8 = L
$$
and then
$$
A \cdot K^{1-\alpha} \cdot L^{\alpha} = A \cdot K^{1-\alpha}  \cdot ( n \cdot 8 ) ^{\alpha} = 8^{\alpha} \cdot A \cdot K^{1-\alpha}  \cdot n ^{\alpha} = \left(8^{\alpha} \cdot A\right) \cdot K^{1-\alpha}  \cdot n ^{\alpha}.
$$
So you can choose $L$ to represent either quantity as long as you take it into consideration when choosing/calibrating $A$.  (Provided that some conditions like $n \cdot 8 = L$ hold or are a reasonable approximation of reality.)"
1990,Why is the derivative of this SWF non-positive?,"This looks like a simple first order condition from constrained optimization. If the maximum is interior, i.e. if $t_i>0$, then the first derivative must be zero. If the maximum is on the boundary, i.e. if $t_i=0$, then the first derivative must be $\leq 0$. If it were $>0$, then we can't have an optimum, because then the value of $U$ could be raised by increasing $t_i$. It can be negative, though, assuming that $t_i$ cannot be negative."
1991,"Derivation on p.99 of Salanie, The Economics of Taxation (2nd edition)","I think it is the chain rule. Let $w'(w) = w$, since we are looking for revealing mechanisms. The condition
$$
\frac{\partial V}{\partial w'} (w'(w),w) = 0
$$
holds for all $w$ because the mechanism is revealing for all types. As the (not partial) differentiate w.r.t. $w$ of the right hand side is 0, the same goes for the differentiate of the left hand size, hence
$$
\frac{d \frac{\partial V}{\partial w'} (w'(w),w)}{d w} = 0.
$$
According to the chain rule
$$
\frac{d \frac{\partial V}{\partial w'} (w'(w),w)}{d w} = \frac{d w'(w)}{d w}\cdot \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial^2 w'} (w'(w),w) + \frac{d w}{d w}\cdot \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial w \partial w'} (w'(w),w),
$$
which in a simplified form is
$$
\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial^2 w'} (w'(w),w) + \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial w \partial w'} (w'(w),w).
$$"
1992,Total profit greater than 100 %,"I think this is just a reflection of the casual language of the popular press. What appears to be in dispute in this question is if profits can be negative or if that case is properly referred to as losses.  I agree that in many contexts this is at best a confusing usage. Most dictionary definitions are clearly implying that profits must be positive (e.g., ""A financial gain"", ""Advantage"", ""Benefit"", or ""income in excess of costs""). "

2005,Why is it called Bayesian Persuasion?,"In a standard cheap-talk setting, a sender (S) has better information on a state of the world and wants to communicate this information to a receiver (R) who then takes an action. However, S and R prefer different actions conditional on the state.
Importantly, S is free to send any message independent of what she knows. That is, she cannot commit to a signal given the true state. This is a complicated strategic setting, and communication may fully break down - in a babbling equilibrium any message is ignored, and R decides based on his prior.
Even equilibria with information transmission can be bad for S."

If your baseline is that you sell 1000 widgets a day at a dollar per widget and suddenly you're selling 1250 widgets a day (or selling out of the 1000 widgets your factory can produce a day by early afternoon), it is reasonable to believe that the demand curve has shifted to the right (there demand at a price of $1/ widget has risen by 25%) and to respond by raising prices.  From that same baseline, if you're suddenly only selling 750 widgets a day, it is reasonable to assume that the demand curve has shifted to the left and that you need to respond by lowering prices.

Below are two experiments that try to get around this selection issue by looking at exogenous variation in worker mathematical ability on labor market outcomes. However, a word of caution. They do not present evidence that mathematical education makes you more productive. Even if all mathematical education is is a signal of intelligence, it can be valuable to individual workers to get more mathematical education, and they will on average benefit from interventions that lower the cost of getting a mathematical education  "

She has a recent paper forthcoming  in the Journal of the European Economic Association, 2016, entitled ""Sovereign Debt Relief and its Aftermath"" with Christoph Trebesch. They study sovereign debt relief in a long-term perspective, using two distinct samples: 1920-1939, and 1978-2010. They published a short Vox-CEPR column on this research."

2051,Difference between objective and subjective distributions in asset pricing models?,"Probability judgments are based on an investors' private information sets, i.e. subjective probabilities. In contrast, objective probabilities are the underlying real probabilities that the world will end up in some state. It is necessary to make the distinction because traders do not have perfect information. See Markowitz (1991) for further explanation."

2057,Financial investment in the composition of GDP,"What you're describing is a change in the capital account, not in GDP. They're related through the balance of payments, in that if a country is running a current account deficit (usually arising through being a net importer), they'll have a capital account surplus (i.e., foreigners will on net buy more domestic assets or domestic owners will be net sellers of foreign assets, or both), and vice-versa. So if you take foreign investment in domestic assets for example, it'll be associated with being a net importer, but it does not appear directly in the national accounting identity $Y=C+I+G+NX$."
2058,Greek default versus Euro exit,"Until the euro remains the official currency, the public and private sector in Greece have to pay wages and invoices in euro. They're also paying external debt in euros. But euros are fleeing the country and the banking system. And Greece can't print more of them. It means that firms and people have less and less liquidity."
2059,price space as a dual of commodity space,"If you want to see a nice usage of duality in economics, in Mas-Colell, Whinston, and Green  there's a nice section on duality in the second or third chapter when talking about Hicksian demand. The treatment is pretty straightforward if the consumption space is real and has a finite dimension. I think understanding that basic usage of duality is illustrative of its general utility."

2062,"If a game admits a unique Nash equilibirum, does common knowledge of rationality implies Nash equilibirum?","No. In static games, common knowledge of rationality is equivalent to rationalizability. Bernheim, in ""Rationalizable Strategic Behavior"" (Econometrica, July 1984) gives an example on page 1012 in Figure 1 of a normalform game in which there is a unique Nash equilibrium, yet multiple strategies are rationalizable."

The simplest Micro 101 example is typically the nonnegative quadrant of $\mathbb{R}^2$, but in general equilibrium theory it is often assumed to be infinite-dimensional since there are infinitely many commodities (each good is differentiated by time and space, etc.)."
2065,Can anyone recommend a resource for monthly trade data for Mexico from before 2010?,I had a look for a few places. Looks like the WTO have something relevant.

2073,Is the Nash product really maximised ex post?,"The Nash bargaining solution DOES maximize the Nash product. You have to separate the playing of the game from the bargaining problem. If the players negotiate a binding agreement they will realize that their maximal total payoff from playing the game is $3$. This can be achieved by playing $(T,L)$ or $(T,C)$, or any mixture of those two profiles."

2080,Confusion about the convexity of the best response correspondence,"I would have thought that the if the opponent strategy $\sigma_{-i}$ is given, even if it is a mixed strategy, then $$u_i(\lambda\sigma_i+(1-\lambda)\sigma_i', \sigma_{-i})= \lambda u_i(\sigma_i, \sigma_{-i})+(1-\lambda)u_i(\sigma_i', \sigma_{-i})$$ and so if  $u_i(\sigma_i, \sigma_{-i})=u_i(\sigma_i', \sigma_{-i})$ then $u_i(\lambda\sigma_i+(1-\lambda)\sigma_i', \sigma_{-i})$ is equal to both of them. If they are best responses then so too is the linear combination strategy"
2081,How to analyze this guessing game?,"A great question! While I won't attempt to provide a complete analysis, here are a few observations:"
2082,"If every company in the economy earns zero economic profit, can they contribute to real economic growth?","The standard measure of the size of an economy is total income. Profit is just one type of income (accruing to owners of firms). Wages that accrue to the workers in a firm can increase, which can be taken from the profit of the firm. In that way, income from other sources can continue to increase even though firms earn zero profit."
2083,What was “Pareto's proof of the immeasurability of utility”?,"I think the ""immeasurability of utility"" refers to what we know today as the non-uniqueness of utility representation. The word ""utility"" also has a slightly different meaning there. As Pareto notes in the mathematical appendix to his 1909 book, Manual of Political Economy (limited preview on Google Books), the ""utility"" measure is "

\\
U_2(p,q) & = p(1-q) + (1-p)q.

There is a unique Nash-equilibrium at $p = q = 1/2$ but all $p$ and all $q$ are rationalizable, because in the equilibrium all strategies are best responses."

2087,Reference request: Gender wage gap / Minority wage gap,"There are a lot of possible places to start when looking at the literature on gender or racial wage discrimination/differentials. Preferably, it'd be good to look at the literature on labor supply as a whole (e.g. Mincer equation, work-leisure tradeoffs etc.), but we could be here all day discussing papers related to modelling wages in general (I am happy to provide some if you would like.) I will do my best to summarize the theoretical and empirical literature I give reference to below. Let us look at differentials."
2088,Definition of Pareto efficiency and prisoner's dilemma,"(A, B) and (B, A) are in fact Pareto efficient."
2089,Can measures of “efficiency” be objective?,"Efficiency can be a very ""objective"" concept because it is conditional on whatever ""non-economic"" environment production will take place. Consider the ""production possibilities frontier"" of a society, that says ""given the resources we have, we can produce $100$ of X only, or $70$ of Y only, or some combination of the two, in a year"".  As long as we are on the production possibility frontier, we are efficient. 
Right. How do we measure how much we can produce? It looks like a totally objective ""engineering"" exercise (however complicated). ""We have available $1000$ labor hours and with them we can produce $100$ units of $X$, it is simple as that"".  "

2091,Independently and Identically distributed random variables,"Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are iid random variables. The 'identically distributed' part means both random variables have the same distribution function (cdf). Formally this can be stated as 
$$F_X(z)=F_Y(z),$$
where $F_X(\cdot)$ and $F_Y(\cdot)$ are the marginal cdfs of $X$ and $Y$, respectively. The 'independently distributed' part means the joint cdf of $X$ and $Y$, denoted $F_{XY}(x,y)$ is simply the product of the marginal cdfs $F_X(x)$ and $F_Y(y)$, i.e. 
$$F_{XY}(x,y)=F_X(x)F_Y(y).$$"

Now if we look at the classical model of utility maximization, if there is a fixed function $f:X\to O$ and a utility function $u:O\to\mathbb{R}$, utility maximization amounts to maximizing with respect to the utility function $v:X\to\mathbb{R}$ given by $v(x)=u\big(f(x)\big)$ for all $x\in X$. There is nothing new here."

remove a sample point that is not on the regression line but still
yields $b_{1}=b_{1}'$ and $b_{0}\ne b_{0}'$. Such points have the property $x_{j}=\bar{x}$,
where $\bar{x}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}$. These points are
known as points without leverage."

2106,How to track costs and calculate price?,"Part of your question is to find the threshold price of a crafted item that covers exactly its cost of production, especially when production is random. Once you know this threshold, the price you will ask to a buyer has to be greater than this threshold. Otherwise, you make losses."
2107,what results can be derived from the average cost curve?,"Assuming a firm is a perfect competitor in input markets, the long-run average cost curve, which traces out the minimums of short-run average cost curves, can be used to characterize economies and diseconomies of scale for a firm. This is definitely a practical concept in business and IO. In an industry where the long-run average cost curve is always decreasing, a natural monopoly will tend to emerge due to the increasing cost-efficiency of larger firms."
2108,Which of Arrow's four desirable properties' is violated in this scenario?,"Note that an alternative being highest-ranked by an agent involves comparisons with all other alternatives, which raises doubts that your method satisfies independence of irrelevant alternatives. Indeed, it does not.  Independence off irrelevant alternatives is actually the only property that is violated."
2109,Reason for Economic Slowdown in Western Nations,"The primary reason is that it is easier to catch up than it is to forge ahead.  India and China have lower GDPs per capita, so they can copy what other countries have done and gain.  But the United States, Canada, and Germany can't copy from India or China, as they are already higher.  Copying would make them lower.  And there's no one higher from whom they can copy.  They can copy a little from each other, but not enough to maintain high growth.  "

2116,What is the general rule for classifying factor that only shift one supply/demand curve or two supply/demand curve?,"Treating supply and demand as functions that relate the price and quantity for a good, a variable that appears as a parameter in both functions will shift both curves. In macro and micro theories, the details of the model will determine what these are."

2122,Non-cooperative Nash Equilibrium in political game,"You could add up the equations
\begin{align}
\delta(1-\underline{S})S_j=e_i(S_i+S_j)^2 \\
\delta(1-\underline{S})S_i=e_j(S_i+S_j)^2
\end{align}
to get
\begin{align}
\delta(1-\underline{S})(S_i+S_j)=(e_i+e_j)(S_i+S_j)^2
\end{align}
which simplifies to
\begin{align}
\delta(1-\underline{S})=(e_i+e_j)(S_i+S_j).
\end{align}
This gives you $(S_i+S_j)$. From the initial equations
\begin{align}
\delta(1-\underline{S})S_j=e_i(S_i+S_j)^2 \\
\delta(1-\underline{S})S_i=e_j(S_i+S_j)^2
\end{align}
you can also get
$$
\frac{S_j}{e_i} = \frac{(S_i+S_j)^2}{\delta(1-\underline{S})} = \frac{S_i}{e_j}, 
$$
which gives you
$$
\frac{S_j}{S_i} = \frac{e_i}{e_j}.
$$
Now you have both the sum and ratio of the variables $S_j,S_i$. Calculating their individual values should be a straightforward matter."

2126,How should one expand the information set in VAR models?,"My recommendation is that you read through this paper from Bernanke, Boivin, and Eliasz. This paper introduced something called factor-augmented VAR. The gist is that you can use principle component analysis to do exactly what you're after. This method allows you to include hundreds of time series in the conditioning information. And FYI, this does allow one to solve the price puzzle with solid economic rationale instead of the ad hoc inclusion of a single time series. "

Assuming You wanted to calculate the inflation rate from between 2003 to 2004, you only need to know the CPI for the starting and ending dates.  So the CPI index in 2003 is 1.84 and the CPI index is 1.889 in 2004."
2139,How could Pablo Escobar earn so much money?,Not sure an economist can answer this particular question about Escobar's wealth and not only because all the given estimates are uncertain. A more interesting question for an economist (or at least for me) would be: What is Escobar's (a drug firm) mark-up? Or what is the economic size of the international market for cocaine?

2146,Indirect changes in Marshallian Demand,"You correctly derived the Marshallian demand function for Cobb-Douglas utility, you notice that the optimal level of consumption of $x$ or $y$ is a function only of the individual's income and the price of said good.  This is an interesting feature of CD-utility, that when the price of good $y$ changes the demand for $x$ doesn't change.  This means that $x$ and $y$ are neither substitutes nor complements to one another. Econport has a nice figure of this:"

The Russian debt to GDP ratio is still very low though:  below 20%, compared to over a 100 for the United States. This is because Russia had a huge stash of cash before the recession, which has shrunk from over 91 billion in 2014 to 32 billion. If this trend continues at some point they will have to start borrowing money to pay for expenses. But I don't see them going bankrupt anytime soon, because their debt to GDP ratio is so low so investors will lend them money against low interest rates."

Couldn't we just have each individual acting alone and rely on the market to put the pieces together into complete products? Coases answer to why this wouldn't work well was transaction costs. If there is a (small) cost to engaging in market transactions then the aggregate cost of the many transactions needed to assemble complicated products will be prohibitive. The solution, argues Coase, is to form an organization (a firm) within which all of these transactions can take place without recourse to the market."
2152,"Why is a 'linear' regression model, with AR(1) error terms, a non-linear model?","To be precise, a model is said to be a linear regression model when it is linear in its parameters.

2155,What Math is used in Development Economics?,"This does depend on whether you're looking to do applied econometric work, in which case statistics is definitely the way to go or something theoretical, in which case a good understanding in the maths you listed will go a long way. Of course it's always better if you understand both - since you're doing a master's in math, you should already be quite fluent with the math required, so I'd go with econometrics."
2156,Oddness of equilibrium points,"It depends on what you mean by generically. The Prisoner's Dilemma has exactly one equilibrium. If you generate the payoffs in your $2 \times 2$ game by drawing payoffs from continuous i.i.d.'s then there is a non-zero probability (seems to me that the exact number is 25%) that you will get a game similar to the Prisoner's Dilemma, i.e. a game with strictly dominant strategies for both players."

we get
$$
(1 + \alpha)\overline{p}^{\alpha}=\alpha y\overline{p}^{\alpha-1}-
\frac{a+1}{\sigma}.
$$
As $\alpha \in [0,1]$, the left hand side of the equation is increasing in $\overline{p}$ and the right hand side is decreasing. At least one of these is strictly monotonic because $\alpha$ cannot be $0$ and $1$ at the same time. Hence at most one solution is possible."

2173,Effect of Strengthening US Dollar on Commodities,"Most global commodities are quoted (priced) in US dollars. The more valuable a dollar becomes relative to other currencies, all other things equal, the more commodity prices have to fall to equilibrate. Imagine everything was priced in corn and people start to value corn more or the amount of corn falls. Either way, all the prices in terms of corn (e.g. ears per barrel of oil) would have to fall as a result. "

When the lag-operator is ""one-sided"" it contains only lags in the one direction. When it is two-sided, it contains ""lags"" in both directions.
In some cases, scholars have used the term ""forward"" operator to verbally contrast it with the ""lag"" operator, but my impression is that it is not so widely used.  "

$$ =  E[W] - \lambda E[W^2 - E[W]^2 + E[W]^2]$$
$$ =  E[W] - \lambda E[W^2 - E[W]^2] + \lambda E[E[W]^2]]$$

2192,How does fuel tankering save airlines money,"Airlines typically have a ""good"" contract for fuel with some supplier for their base airports (they buy a LOT of fuel and hence, they are able to negotiate higher discount). When a plane flies to a small(er) airport (e.g. where the airline goes 2-3 times a week), there they won't have a discount, so they would have to pay more. Therefore, it might be a case that it is more efficient (or profitable) to take on board more fuel (even if it means that the plane will burn more fuel) than to buy fuel for a higher price, i.e. they might prefer to burn more of cheaper fuel than burn less but of more expensive one. I am talking about the case of domestic flights: the base price of fuel might vary quite a bit (you can easily google fuel prices for different airports in various countries). So if it is a case for domestic flight, a similar observation could possibly occur for international flights. "

$$\frac{x_j}{x_i}=\frac{a_j p_i}{a_i p_j},$$
or equivalently,
$$x_j =\frac{a_j p_i}{a_i p_j} x_i.$$
Substituting this into equation 3 for $j=2,...,n$ and $i=1$ (solving for the demand function for good 1) we get
$$M=p_1x_1 + \sum_{j=2}^n p_j  \frac{a_j p_1}{a_1 p_j} x_1$$
$$M=p_1x_1 + \sum_{j=2}^n  \frac{a_j p_1}{a_1} x_1$$
$$M=p_1x_1 + \frac{p_1}{a_1} x_1\sum_{j=2}^n a_j $$
$$M=p_1x_1(1 + \frac{1}{a_1}\sum_{j=2}^n a_j). $$
Finally, solving for $x_1$ we get
$$x_1^* = \frac{M}{p_1}(1+ \frac{\sum_{j=2}^n a_j}{a_1})^{-1}$$

2223,Abolishing all tariffs without reciprocity,"You get cheaper access to inputs. For a large advanced economy that is relatively diversified, it is possible that unilateral tariff reductions across many or all sectors can be good for the economy by freeing up resources presently occupied in low-value activities with few prospects to contribute to technological progress.

Person B could just wait to see if someone else finances person A and then buy from A if the factory is successful. A single individual lending, or even small businesses lending out money can be a relatively large amount of money for that entity (so, high risk), whereas banks are able to diversify risks, by making many different loans and spending time evaluating how risky different people are."

If the transfer fees are large enough, then the marginal cost to move between exchanges just needs to stay inside the gross bid-ask spread.  It can probably move outside that spread because there is an additional risk for one who moves between exchanges.  Not all exchanges move back and forth between real world bank accounts equally well, nor do all have equal trading depth.  Additionally, the time value of money between the exchanges is probably sufficient to eat up any arbitrage.  It may be worth giving up arbitrage profits if they are traded for the time value of money profits.  If the arbitrage is small and the cost is great, you can carry a wider bid-ask spread and get away with it as a market maker."

The dynamic optimisation problem is to maximise the discounted present value of utility, utility being a function of consumption meeting the standard conditions $U_C > 0$ and $U_{CC} < 0$. "

2265,When gradient of utility function is a zero vector,"This concerns the partial derivatives of the utility function with respect to goods, and not the partial derivative of the Lagrangian of the maximization problem. "
2266,"Suppose I have a preference satisfy all basic assumptions, how to show consumer problem solution is unique","In that case you would still have a problem showing the existence of a solution. Without existence, it makes little sense to think about uniqueness. The reason a continuous utility function (implied by some of those preference assumptions you gave) has a maximum at all is because a continuous function achieves a maximum somewhere on a compact set, which in this case is B."

2269,Connection between negative interest rates and negative bond yields,I cannot see the mechanism as to why if central banks set rates in positive territory when long term bonds yields are negative how this will cause the yield curve to invert.
2270,Calculating Time to Balanced Growth Path,"a) Your calculations are correct, but in order for consumption to be positive, so for
$$
c_t=\bigg(\frac{R}{(\beta R)^{\frac{1}{\gamma}}}-1\bigg)k_t > 0,
$$
you will need to additional conditions. The first is the obvious $k_t > 0$. If there is nothing to gain interest on, there will be no growth and no consumption. The second is the more nuanced
$$
\frac{R}{(\beta R)^{\frac{1}{\gamma}}}-1 > 0.
$$
This is actually a necessary condition for the existence of an optimal solution.  The inequality may be reformulated as
$$
\beta \cdot R^{1 - \gamma} < 1.
$$
If this does not hold, then given any consumption path the consumer would gain by pushing off all consumption one period further. Since there is no infinitely distant timeperiod, no optimum exists."
2271,Change in the way unemployment is calculated in the US?,"The most likely explanation for discrepancies that political partisans like to pick at is that presidents like to cite different measures of unemployment. The BLS has 6 alternative categories of labor under-utilization. The U-6 measure of unemployment with seasonal adjustment stands at 9.7%. Although the official rate may be under 5% as in the BLS's September 2016 release here, many people may not feel like the economy is much better, and partisans can argue over which measure of employment or labor force participation rate is most useful."
2272,Why is the money supply perfectly inelastic?,The Fed controls the nominal money supply as they are the only ones who can add or remove money from the economy by printing it. Real money supply is only affected by increases or decreases in inflation and is fixed assuming inflation is 0. In the IS-LM model which is what I assume you are referring to it is assumed that inflation is fixed or that the fed will maintain the real money supply at a given point by changing the nominal money supply for given price levels.

2274,The appeal of low-dividend stocks when trading with government debt,"In the paper cited at the end of this answer, the incentives for all three parties involved are discussed. Not only did the creditors suffer from a lower return after the conversion, they also faced longer maturities and, given the strong heterogeneity in lending terms across bonds, also a destruction of bond specific information.

I have the 1953 edition which is counted as ""3d"", but by reading the included introductions to the 2nd and to the 3d editions, it appears that nothing of substance has been changed in chapter 3, where I locate the issue of equivalence up to linear transformations.  "
2277,"Convert DSGE paper to structural econometrics, anything to be noted？","There's no correct method to do this.  DSGE guys will estimate the model by doing something like this: plugging in priors for their parameters and then running an optimization that minimizes the distance between model and data moments while maximizing the log likelihood from the priors.  The data moments for them will be well known values of variances and covariance of the deviations of c, y, i, p from trend.  "

2291,What Does “Quantity” Represent When Looking at Supply and Demand?,"Each curve simply shows the amount of goods that producers would supply at given prices and how many units of goods consumers would demand at all the different prices. Let's say the price of wooden chairs would be 5 million Euros. Producers would want to supply a large quantity of wooden chairs, since they're so profitable. Consumers would likely demand very little though. However since no one suppliers want to sell more than people want to buy the price will have to change and will not stay there in equilibrium. We only have an equilibrium when all parties agree, otherwise transactions don't take place. That's one intuitive way of thinking about it if it helps you."
2292,How do excessive foreign reserves cause inflation?,"Because you are taking other currencies off the market and/or selling your own currency, and increasing the supply of your own currency relative to others."

2295,"How rate rise by the Fed, higher than market expectation will lead to strengthening of Dollar?","A higher than expected interest rate in the US would result in a higher than expected interest rate differential with other currencies. This will drag more money to the US as investors will try to benefit from this higher interest rate. Moreover, a faster tightening may create the perception that the Fed is more confident about the economic environment. This good news for the US can translate in dollar appreciation."
2296,Why does a stronger currency have a tightening effect on economic conditions?,"Tight monetary policy reduces the amount of money available in the economy and strengthens the currency. It is usually implemented by raising interest rates, increasing capital requirements for banks, or sometimes selling government bonds."
2297,Is it necessary to have currency in an ideal centrally-planned economy?,How does the planner know that his central plan is the ideal one? The conventional story is that he's got an objective function that maximizes the sum of all the society's members' utility. He maximizes that sum by :
2298,A term for utility functions based on the max operator,"The Rawlsian welfare function, which takes the form of the min of all agent's utility, is often called the maximin function, because it maximizes minimum utility. In the spirit of that nomenclature, your function is a maximax utility function. And, apparently, this function does see some use. It is sometimes called the optimistic decision criteria, because a person evaluating projects based on their best outcome uses a similar evaluation function. "

In optimum the shadow price (Lagrange multiplier) belonging to the condition $f(x) = y$ is the marginal cost."
2304,Confusion on Strategy Sets in a simultaneous move game,"There is no conflict. The strategy is a function which maps decision points to actions, that is it tells the player in each decision point (to be precise, in each information set) what she should do. In a dynamic game there are usually more decisions points, so this function nature of the strategy is more obvious. "
2305,Does the introduction of credit card affects Money Velocity?,Credit cards are a way of deferring payment in the form of inter-temporal substitution; it helps reduce the household's liquidity constraint that may prevent it from consumption smoothing as much as they would like if their transitory income was much more spread over the household's lifetime.
2306,Fractional reserve banking and bank insolvency,"Let's assume (as you do if I understand well) that the bank's only liabilities are deposits, so that the bank's equity valuation is simply the value of assets minus deposits. In order to provide loans the bank will have to hold 10% of those funds as reserves in its central bank account (the account it holds at the central bank, written in central bank money or base money), the the maximum amount the bank could lend out would be 90% of its liabilities + equity."
2307,What is the difference between quarterly GDP and annual GDP?,"You might not find a page explaining (in an easy manner) how quarterly GDP is calculated because it is done by several different means in different countries and the calculation/estimation methods can get confusing. If you want to know how a certain country generates a quarterly GDP figure, you should check the country's official economic statistics page - the descriptions of the statistic usually list at least something about the collection process."

2316,What happens to the billions in Euros that Greece owes if it leaves the Euro,"If you owe euros you have to pay in euros. If for example the British government owes euros, then they get some funds (perhaps take another loan) and in case this is in a currency different from euros they convert it to euros on the market. If the sum is large enough it is wise not to convert it all at once but in smaller installments. This way the exchange rate stays stable and you can also get a better deal."
2317,Why is it that poverty incidence is high in the agricultural sector?,Well I think that agriculture poverty is there because farmer can't store its product and sell that when prices are good as his product is perishable. With this he has to remain busy throughout the year either harvesting or in production and has no control over markets.
2318,Fast way to write out the utility optimization problem for a Cobb-Douglas function?,"Well all Cobb-Douglas have an structure, it is the utility that makes shares constants as budget shares independent of prices 
$p_{l}x^{CD}_{l}(p,w)/w=\alpha_{l}$ with $u^{CD}(x)=\sum_{l}\alpha_{l}log(x_{l})$ and $\sum_{l}\alpha_{l}=1$. 
then you can go back and compute $x_l(p,w)$, with this the indirect utility, then invert to obtain the expenditure and then derive to get the hicksian. 
Not sure if this is what you want but some utility functions have a defining property, the same with the leontief or CES."
2319,Changing the base year of Real GDP from 2001 Euros to 1990 Geary–Khamis dollars,"In general, real output is  calculated like this:

2337,Market Behavior under expected and unexpected news,"Short answer: the market has a forecast of the government numbers but the market considers the actual government numbers to contain information not available to the market. Therefore when unemployment  is lower than the market forecasts this indicates that on average things will be better than than the market forecast before the release. This is not to say that the forecast has no use, nor that the government number is perfect. Instead, it merely requires that there be some information in the release not in the forecast such that differences from the forecast are informative."
2338,Economic Impact of A Student Loan Bubble Popping?,"If, as you say, 15% of student loan borrowers were to default and the government were to forgive their loans, that would simply be a transfer of wealth from the government to those borrowers (on the order of about 15% of \$1.3 trillion, or about \$200 billion). What happened from there would depend first on whether the government funded that transfer by cutting other spending or by issuing debt. Inflation is a basically unrelated issue— the monetary authority (the Federal Reserve) is independent of the fiscal authority (Congress and the Treasury), and as they say, the monetary authority acts last."
2339,How does corporate income tax apply?,"""Income tax"" for corporations means ""profit tax"". The 1.500 euros is never called ""income"" but ""Revenue"", or ""Net Revenue"", or ""Net Sales turnover"" or something similar. But never ""income"" -""income"" is equivalent to ""profit"", for companies or professionals. (*)"
2340,Should minimum wage be regulated for developing countries,"A welfare or efficiency enhancing minimum wage can be justified in several theoretical settings. For example, if there is monopsony (a single employer), the employer can internalize the effect of his labor demand on the labor market price (the wage) and therefore holds down both labor demand and wages. A minimum wage can therefore increase both employment and wages. In a developing country with a dominant industry like resource extraction or tourism controlled by a small number of connected families, this might be a decent model and therefore an industry specific minimum wage perhaps could work. Another theoretical motivation, if an industry has inelastic labor demand, due to pricing power in the good markets and low substitutability of other inputs for labor (maybe French wine would be an example of this), then the minimum wage could raise wages without great inefficiencies or reduced employment.

2345,What would happen to the economy if the Fed's discount window completely stopped?,"First, one note on the premise. The Fed basically operates a giant ledger for financial institutions, each of which has a certain balance in its ""master account"". Over $3 trillion is moved between accounts each day via Fedwire, and these accounts are also used for settling most traditional checks and ACH transactions, which include many of the everyday transactions in the economy. Even alternative payment networks not provided by the Fed, like CHIPS, ultimately use the Fed's ledger to clear net payments. "
2346,International date line,"The consequence would be confusion, if someone is further east of you it's natural to think they're ahead of time (relative to you).  Especially if you're used to the ubiquitous maps of the globe (with Europe/Africa in the middle, the Americas to the left and Japan/Oceania on the right).  Confusion then might arise in some economical contexts that are highly standardised."

Unfortunately, it does not discuss mixed-data sampling (MIDAS), as that is a more advanced topic. I am not aware of any introductory treatment  of that material."
2349,Educational self sufficiency,"According to the OECD: Israel's spending per-student is low relative to other OECD countries. Given that countries like the US have both higher spending per-student and higher enrolment rates, it is not clear what a switch to heavier state subsidisation (both the UK and US already heavily subsidise universities) would achieve. Bear in mind that most of the best US universities privately subsidise talented students from poor backgrounds so that the highest fees are mostly bourne by the wealthy."
2350,Information sets game theory,"As a first point, in general, the dotted line indicates that the nodes are in the same information set. So in your example, there is a single information set for the Red player and as such she has 2 actions---since she cannot tell which of the 3 nodes she is in, she cannot condition her action on this information, and therefore must take the same action (either left ($l$) or right ($r$)) irrespective of her position."
2351,Why GDP series always has an unit root problem?,"In short there is no apriori reason per se why GDP should always contain unit root, although many macroeconomists would argue it does. First, you have to make a distinction between real and nominal GDP, I will focus more on the former as common in economics. "
2352,Absolute vs Relative Risk Aversion,"Given a utility function $u(c)$, $c>0$, with $u'(c)>0, u''(c) <0$. Regarding the sign of the second derivative, if it is zero, then both measures are zero, if it is positive, it would imply increasing marginal utility, and I don't remember having seen these attitude-towards-risk measures for such a utility function.

2356,What would happen to US economy before US government lose control over its national debt?,"It depends.  Mathematically, you just need GDP to grow at the same rate as the debt grows, and then you can sustain deficit spending indefinitely. But this simply shifts the line of questioning to ""can GDP grow indefinitely"", and for most people the obvious answer is ""no""."

2369,The concept of expansion of an information structure,"You have to be careful what you can say is that if $\underline{S}$ be given by $(T^1,\pi^1)$ and $S$ is any information structure, say given by $(T^2,\pi^2)$, then there exists an expansion $S^*$ of $\underline S$ given by $(T^1\times T^2, \pi^1\cdot \pi^2)$ where $\pi^1\cdot \pi^2$ is the product distribution of $\pi^1$ and  $\pi^2$. Note that I have constructed the expansion, thus shown its existence."
2370,Multivariate linear regression: how to test for whether the slopes are the same?,"Estimate the model 
$$W_i=a_1+a_2E_i+a_3G_i+a_4E_iG_i+\epsilon_i,$$
where $W,E,G$ denote wage, education, and an indicator for gender (e.g. 1 if male, 0 if female), respectively. The term $EG$ is an interaction term obtained by multiplying the gender dummy by education. A simple t-test of the hypothesis $H_0: a_4=0$ will tell you if the effects of additional education on wage are significantly different for different genders. "
2371,How does a bank create new money when it pays its own staff?,"If an employee performed work there is a liability called ""current liabilities"". Paying into the employee's account is just changing one kind of liability into another kind of  liability of the same size so total liabilities is unchanged and total assets is unchanged. The new liability is a recorded as a deposit. "

2375,"If two variables are not cointegrated, can one still cause the other?",Causality between time-series variables does not require the two to be cointegrated. 
2376,Imbens and Angrist (1994): the $D_i(z)$ variables,"I hope this meets your idea for intuition, but equation 1 comes from using the Law of Total Expectation with the independence condition (Condition 1). There are four possible values of $D_i(z)-D_i(w)$. $$D_i(z)=D_i(w)=1$$ $$D_i(z)=D_i(w)=0$$ $$D_i(z)>D_i(w)$$ $$D_i(z)<D_i(w)$$. Consider the LHS of (1). $$E[(D_i(z)-D_i(w))*(Y_i(1)-Y_i(0))]$$ From the four possibilities above it is clear that this expectation only takes on a value other than 0 when the last two are true, where the third option gives a value of 1 and the fourth a value of -1. So then using the Law of Total Expectation with the independence condition yields the equality from the paper."

2379,Blocking Coalitions,"Coalition formation is not the same as majority voting. Say, in a single good economy, individual 1 has the entire endowment, so $\mathbf e=(1,0,0,0,0,0)$. Then individual 1 forms a blocking coalition to any allocation $\mathbf x=(x_1,\dots,x_6)$ where $x_1<1$. "

To find the probability of a car having quality less than or equal to $\mu$, we consider the CDF of $x$, $F(x)$, assuming $x$ is uniformly distributed over the support $[0,2]$:"
2381,Economic interpretation of the concavity of the expenditure function,The expenditure function is always concave. 
2382,What are the drivers of the price of land?,"Because of population growth, savings, and technological innovation the stock of capital and augmented labor are growing over time. These forces raise the marginal product of land. Unlike capital, the supply of land is fixed. This means that the supply of land can't increase in response to the rising marginal product. Investors have to be indifferent between investing a dollar in holding land and a dollar of productive capital. Capital is paid its marginal product ($r$). For investors to be indifferent, each dollar buys $1/P$ worth of capital, and that fraction of a unit of land returns $r$. One unit of real estate actually returns $rP$. So, over time, the forces that raise the marginal product of labor and capital, population growth, capital deepening, and technological innovation, raise the marginal product of land and therefore push up the price because the quantity cannot adjust.

2384,Can debt to GDP ratio be reduced transfering debt to local autorities?,"To answer your second question: a country could probably do that, but it would achieve not much more thereby than clean up that particular statistic. In Europe, the Treaty of Maastricht that specifies the maximum debt-to-gdp ratio a country can have pertains to the whole government sector, which is defined so as to include local authorities (see this explanation on the site of the Belgian government https://www.debtagency.be/en/datagovernmentdebtdebt).

2385,"Show that the dividend price ratio is a ARMA(p, q) process","Hi: I don't know where you got the expression for $d_{t-1} - p_{t-1}$ but assuming that's true, then I think you are basically there. Take your final expression and  consider the two lagged white noise terms first. They can be added together to make one lagged white noise term because I'm pretty certain that the sum of two white noise processes is still white noise. Similarly, the two non lagged white noise terms can be added to make one non-lagged white noise term. So, you end up with an MA(1) so the whole expression is ARMA(2,1). Granted the MA(1) part will have some complicated constant coefficients on both the lagged and non-lagged term but they are not terribly important. Also, you can always normalize so that the non-lagged coefficient of the MA(1) piece is 1.0.  If you or anyone thinks this reasoning is flawed, let me know because I don't see the flaw in it and am all ears. Thanks."

2401,Basic New Keynesian Model - Price and Wage Level after shock,"Try to give a look at what happens to inflation's IRF. If it stays positive for the whole horizon of the IRF then simply prices have increased over time at the inflation rate. I guess that any non-degenerate price level (nominal!) is compatible with such model structure, as its system is written down in growth rates, as that's what loglinearised variables are."

2403,Where are bank loans in balance sheet?,"In the link one can very clearly see that the company has no contractually short term debt, and in the short-term (i.e. in the next 12 months) has to pay part of its long term debt. Also, that the debt amounts are not included in the line ""Accounts payable"" "
2404,Are expensive cities economically threatened by an inability to house low-income workers?,"If it was not feasible, then the residents of the city would bid up the price of the services provided by the low-paying jobs until the induced rise in wages (and the fall in rents) would make housing affordable enough for people who are supposed to provide the ""make the world go round"" services. It's important to note that this process can't create housing units out of nothing; so the restricted supply of housing still leads to inefficiency - if no new houses are constructed, people who are dissatisfied with the lack of affordable basic services have to move out of the city until enough housing is freed up for workers who are going to provide these services. This leads to inefficient allocation of labor, etc etc."
2405,Expected values vs uncertainty,"One can distinguish between probabilistic randomness (which can be quantified) and uncertainty. This article by a Fed Researcher discusses this: “The Stock Market: Beyond Risk Lies Uncertainty” (Frank Schmid). As the tag to the question suggests, this is associated with Keynes, and post-Keynesian economics at present. Therefore, if you look at the post-Keynesian literature, you will see more discussion of uncertainty."
2406,Profit maximization under uncertainity,"Let $G$ be the cumulative distribution function for the buyers' willingness to pay. If there is no cost, expected profit is simply expected revenue. The revenue is quantity times price. If the unit of the good is actually sold, this is just the price. Now the probability that the good is sold at price $p$ is the probability that the willingness to pay is not smaller than $p$, which is $\big(1-G(p)\big)$. So in total, expected profit is simply"

2408,Is real income the same as present value of income?,"Real income refers to the income of an individual or group after taking into consideration the effects of inflation on purchasing power. For example, if you receive a 2% salary increase over the previous year and inflation for the year is 1%, then your real income only increases by 1%. Conversely, if you receive a 2% raise in salary and inflation is at 3%, then your real income shrinks by 1%."
2409,Regression - Testing for autocorrelation in the presence of heteroscedasticity,"General remarks: The BG test under homoskedasticity can be done using the bgtest command in the lmtest package of R. The $(n-p)R_{aux}^2$ version mentioned in link works only under homoskedasticity. In the presence of heteroskedasticity, Wooldridge (1991, JoE) gives a discussion (as noted in the Wooldridge textbook you mentioned)."
2410,Impact of Natural Disaster on Production Function,"Suppose the Cobb-Douglas production function is $Y = AK^{\alpha}L^{\beta}$, and the effect of the disaster is to reduce $K$ from $K_0$ to $K_1$. If any change in $A$ and $L$ is insignificant, then you can look at this in two ways:"

2412,How to enhance one's comprehension of the descriptive meaning of formal economic statements?,"I faced a similar issue coming from mathematics where context plays very little role in framing theorems. I was a top maths student. But Econ grad school was difficult for this. The solution I found (and successfully so since I publish well) is to read as much “soft Econ” as possible: policy discussions, business reports, newspaper analysis. Then I went back to formalized economics, and it worked. The conclusion I reached is that economics theorems are very context dependent, and typically cannot be grasped without cultural/policymaking/business context. "

2414,Do granting subsidies always cause allocative inefficiency?,"Your intuition is correct: in cases of market failure when the price under-represents the marginal value to society as a whole (for example if positive externalities are present) then granting the subsidy would improve allocative efficiency. As long as the subsidy is not greater than the positive externality, then the only loss in that case arises from the overhead in managing the subsidy - the bureaucratic cost. This is typically less than the inefficiency resulting from the market failure, so society gets a net gain from the subsidy."

2426,Why recent crises all started with a housing bubble?,"In a fractional reserve monetary system loans create money and loan repayments destroy money. Most bank lending in modern times is for the purpose of purchasing real estate. So the amount of money that exists in the economy is closely tied to the enthusiasm for purchasing real estate. You could not really make this kind of statement for any other class of asset - this is why the housing market in particular has such an impact on the economy. During the upswing of a housing bubble the money supply will be growing fast, but when the bubble bursts the money supply will fall (as existing mortgages are repaid) leading to recession. The whole point of QE is to counteract this fall in the money supply."

2439,How can a citizen contribute to get his country out of the poverty trap?,"I think the best way for an individual citizen to improve their country's economic development is to raise their productivity, while also following ethical standards. ""Raising productivity"" is a very traditional economic viewpoint, and it basically requires one to move away from rural or subsistence living and towards activities that contribute to society, as measured by the income that you generate. But, I think there also needs to be a focus on long-term developmental outcomes, which may not necessarily be tied to economic profit because of negative externalities."

The model predicts that competition will lead private schools to give tuition discounts to more able students, and that this will give rise to an equilibrium exhibiting stratification by income and ability between the public and private sectors and to a hierarchy of schools within the private sector. Epple, Figlio and Romano (JPubE 2004) submits this model to the empirical test quite sucessfully. "

In middle age Europe, there were essentially no schools. Education was reserved almost exclusively for those wealthy enough to employ a teacher (meaning aristocrats) and for clergy who needed to be able to read (and sometimes write) scripture. Thus, it's not clear where you propose that people should have learnt to write and calculate in the way necessary to do these jobs. Some estimates put the literacy levels at the time as low as 6%, so we are really talking about the intellectual elite of society at the time. "

Job applicants know their skills with certainty, while employers do not know the skills of applicants. The application process is designed to increase the employers information set so that they can select the best candidate. However, applicants have an incentive to lie, so this process may not always be effective."
2466,Money supply control vs. interest rate control,"I think that with money supply control the central bank actively influences The money supply by adding or withdrawing money. By setting the interestrates the central bank influences the lendingcapacity of the banks and the people, lowering the interestrate creates more lendingcapacity and thus 'adds' to the moneysupply... By setting interest rates higher it diminishes lending capacity and thus 'tightens' the money supply..  "
2467,How are purchasing power parity (PPP) conversions computed?,"The calculation of PPP is a very complex, resource consuming task. As you can imagine, coming up with a single number comparing countries relative purchasing power means many assumptions have to be taken (i.e there is a trade-off between realism and simplicity). "

However, there is a big gap between 'adopting' cutting-edge technology at that level and the much more comprehensive adoption of such technology by developed countries.  The benefits of technology in developing countries may be limited by any of the following:"
2471,Does the price level in a competitive market have to be at the intersection of the Average Cost curve and the Marginal Cost curve?,"One of the assumptions of perfect competition is that firms are price takers. Ultimately price is determined by the quantity of goods supplied, and with perfect competition, there are infinite (or an arbitrarily large) number of firms, so a firm that changes their price by itself will simply have no business, since there are cheaper places to buy from. The quantity supplied will also not change, and will leave the prices unchanged."
2472,Is increasing the money supply possible with a gold standard? How about controlling interest rates?,"Yes,  in principle,  under a gold standard,  the central bank can buy more gold, or build a mine and mine it, which increases money supply. This lowers  the short run interest rates. But the issue is that it typically can't fight the market price of gold: when the price of gold increases beyond the parity, people rush to exchange their paper currency for gold at the bank. This happens until money becomes so scarce that ir regains its value relative to gold."

2482,Why did US dollar appreciate during the Global Economic Crisis (2007-09),"Because dollar is a major reserve currency. When a financial crisis occurs in other countries, like India, Brasil, Russia, etc, everyone sells stocks and liquiates assets to raise cash. But the cash they want to raise is usually dollars or euros. When a crisis hit the US, everyone started selling assets FOR dollars. I.e. they were buying dollas for stocks, trillions of dollars worth. This demand for cash appreciated dollar. There was a multitude of other factors involved, as discussed in this paper: Dollar Appreciation in 2008: Safe Haven, Carry Trades, Dollar Shortage and Overhedging http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1519814 "

2494,Help understanding expression for continuous discounting,"From time $0$ to time $t$ the profit flow is constant $\Delta$. The discounted value of the profit flow of any instance $s$ is $\Delta \cdot e^{-r s}$. To get the total discounted profit we will need the integral of this from $0$ to $t$:
$$
\int_0^t \Delta \cdot e^{-r s} \ ds = \left. \frac{\Delta \cdot e^{-r s}}{-r} \right]_0^t = \frac{\Delta \cdot e^{-r t}}{-r} - \frac{\Delta \cdot e^{-r \cdot 0}}{-r}
$$
And as $e^{-r \cdot 0} = e^0 = 1$, this is
$$
- \frac{\Delta \cdot e^{-r t}}{r} + \frac{\Delta \cdot 1}{r} = \Delta \cdot \frac{1 -e^{-r t}}{r}.

where $1+r_{t+1}$ and $1$ are the respective prices of current and future money measured in future money. So basically what is happening is that you calculate how much utility an additional unit of future money would buy you in the current and in the future period. In optimum these quantities are equal. You can also rewrite the equation into the form of the familiar MRS condition:
$$
\frac{MU_t}{MU_{t+1} } = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{1+r_{t+1}}}.

There are numerous ways in which a government can control an interest rates: one of which is to control the money supply. I feel that in your case, you are assuming that the amount of money in the economy and the speed of money flow is fixed. However, we can control the interest rates by controlling the money supply. When we want to make an interest rates at a fixed term, we want to pump more money into the economy and thus increasing the supply of money and keeping the interest rates as low as it used to be. Thus it is possible for that to happen. Please note that I have also assume that the interest rates dixed and the economy is not running at the intermediate or full capacity"

This function shows how much money the actors keep. (Not wealth, but wealth that is not tied down assets.) It is assumed in the IS-LM model that $L(Y,i)$ is increasing in $Y$ because if you have more income you also spend more and to do this you need more money. It is also assumed that $L(Y,i)$ is decreasing in $i$. If the interest rates are high you have an incentive to deposit more of your wealth and keep less of it liquid/instantly accessible."

The thing that might confuse you is that the formula you are given is an approximation for the true price elasticity of demand given by
\begin{align}
     \eta=\frac{dS\Big/ S}{dp\Big/ p}
 \end{align} 
 where $d$ is the derivative operator. The approximation 
 \begin{align}
     \frac{\%\Delta S}{\% \Delta p}
 \end{align}
 only works for very small changes in $p$ and $S$. 
 To see why the elasticity of demand is $\mid 1 \mid$, let $b$ be the fixed amount spend on $S$. Then the quantity demanded $S$ is given by

2544,How can I write a conditional expectation of finite state markov process in matrix notation,"Let the $n$ states of the finite-state markov chain be denoted
by $\{x_1,...,x_n\}$ and let $\vec e = [e(x_1), ..., e(x_n)]'$.
Now,
first note that because $X_{t+1} \mid X_t$ is independent of $W_{t+1}$, we can write
\begin{align*}
\exp(\eta) e(x) &= E[\exp(D'x + x' F W_{t+1})] E[ e(X_{t+1}) \mid X_t = x] \\
  &= \exp(D'x + x' F F' x)\, E[ e(X_{t+1}) \mid X_t = x] .
\end{align*}
Then, because this must hold for all values $x= x_1, ..., x_n$, we
can assemble the following vector equation,
\begin{align*}
\vec e \, \exp(\eta)
  &= 
\begin{bmatrix}
\exp(D'x_1 + x_1' F F' x_1)\, E[ e(X_{t+1}) \mid X_t = x_1] \\
... \\
\exp(D'x_n + x_n' F F' x_n)\, E[ e(X_{t+1}) \mid X_t = x_n]  \\
\end{bmatrix}\\
  &= 
\text{diag} \begin{bmatrix}
\exp(D'x_1 + x_1' F F' x_1) \\
... \\
\exp(D'x_n + x_n' F F' x_n) \\
\end{bmatrix}
\, \mathbb P \, \vec e \\
  &= 
\text{diag}(f)\, \mathbb P \, \vec e \\
\end{align*}
where $f = [ \exp(D'x_1 + x_1' F F' x_1),  ..., \exp(D'x_n + x_n' F F' x_n) ]'$
and $\text{diag}$ is the operator that takes a vector and places
it on the diagonal of a matrix where the off-diagonal elements are zero.
So, we can express the equation as a linear operator $\mathbb M$ on $\vec e$
with
\begin{align*}
\text{diag}(f)\, \mathbb P \, \vec e
  &= \vec e \, \exp(\eta) \\
\mathbb M \vec e &= \vec e \, \exp(\eta).

2557,Simple hawk-dove type super-game,"Finally, I believe it is easy to answer it. Well, in case where some player will not cooperate and the triger strategy is enabled, we have the following soloutions:
Soppuse that p2 does not cooperate in the first round so, he will gain a payoof of 1, but in the second round p1 plays $a_2$ and he won't cooperate with p2 in perpetual. Thus, we have that p2 will play $a_1$, because by playing $a_2$ he increases his looses and the value function is:
$$V_2^{NC}=1-1\cdot\delta-1\cdot\delta^2-1\cdot\delta^3+...=1-\delta\sum_{j=1}^{+\infty}\delta^{j}=1-\dfrac{\delta}{1-\delta}$$
Hence, they will cooperate if:
$$0>1-\dfrac{\delta}{1-\delta}\Rightarrow \delta>\dfrac{1}{2}$$
Differently, if both players choose trigger strategies, so p2 also chooses $a_2$, then both will make looses of -2 and the value function is:
$$V_2^{NC}=1-2\cdot\delta-2\cdot\delta^2-2\cdot\delta^3+...=1-2\delta\sum_{j=1}^{+\infty}\delta^{j}=1-\dfrac{2\delta}{1-\delta}$$
and hence they will cooperate if:
$$0>1-\dfrac{2\delta}{1-\delta}\Rightarrow \delta>\dfrac{1}{3}$$"

2571,Understanding agents selecting among markets,"If a market has free entry, then profit will tend to zero in the long run. Monopolistic competition and perfect competition are both characterized by zero long-run profit. Of course a firm would prefer to enter a market in which long run profits can be earned, but such markets are characterized by barriers to entry. "
2572,Does omitted variable bias 'contaminate' coefficients for regressors not correlated with the omitted variable?,"I would suspect that if  $X_1$ is independent of $X_3$, then it must imply $E[X_1*X_3]$ is equal to $E[X1] * E[X_3]$, given this you can conclude that the Covariance is 0. $Cov(X_1,X_3) = E[X_1*X_3] - E[X_1]* E[X_3]$. If the Covariance is 0 between these two variables then so is the correlation. Thus I would believe that removing $X_3$ from the regression and having it's effect enter the error term would not result in having $γ_1$ be biased as the $X_3$ in the residual term does not have correlation with $γ_1$.

First, take the log of this production function, and then approximate this to the first-order using the McLaurin series for $\gamma$."
2579,Why don't we draw National Income Curve(45 deg. line) simultaneously with graph for Saving Function?,The role of 45 degree line while showing a consumption function is that the 45 degree line translates the values on x-axis to equal values on y-axis. The consumption function is drawn on an income and aggregate expenditure plane. Hence the 45 degree line shows consumption + savings which is aggregate output or aggregate supply or income.

2581,Does Bad Money Drive Good Money Out Of Circulation,"Gresham's law has to do with commodity money. When several types of commodity money are available (e.g., both gold and silver coins), the one with the lowest quality will drive the rest out of circulation. The underlying idea is that everyone will try to hoard the ""good money"" while using the ""bad money"" for payments."

2583,The use of preference relations in choice theory and the $\succsim$ symbol,"About your second question, Gérard Debreu, in his book Theory of Value, says in the notes of chapter 1 that the $\succsim$ notation is due to Herstein and Milnor. So, probably, this is the origin of symbol for preferences."
2584,Why CPI differs so much from consumption deflator?,The discrepancy between these two standard measures of inflation stems mostly from the differences between the basket of goods used by each index.

Franchisee A under its current franchise arrangement has to pay \$100 a year of minimum rent until the current arrangement expires in 2025. Franchisee B, on the other hand, has to pay \$75 a year but its arrangement expires in 2019."
2590,Why is a Normal Yield Curve a sign of a healthy economy?,"The prevalent hypothesis for the normal slope of the yield curve is due to a combination of the expectations hypothesis, and a liquidity premium. 
Recall what the yield curve is measuring- it graphs Yield to maturity against a bond of maturity t, for different time horizons t. This yield to maturity is generally thought of as the interest rate.
First, the assumption is that we hold constant the risk profile of the bonds in question- think of just looking at the yields of T-Bills for different horizons.
The expectations hypothesis is straightforward: it specifies that the yield to maturity (upto an approximation) of a two year bond is the average of the current yield and the expected future yield. As such, if the yield curve is flat, this would mean that the interest rates are not expected to change. Generally speaking, the yield curve is upward sloping. This can still occur under constant interest rate expectations, because people have a preference for liquidity. As such, not having liquidity for 2 periods is more costly than 1, and hence this premium is reflected in a liquidity premium on the yield curve. However, if the yield curve has a sharp upward slope, the economy is expected to do well. This is because first, output is positively correlated with interest rates. This is, in part, due to the fact that a boom is correlated with increased spending, leading to inflation, and the government controlling money supply (inflation) by raising interest rates. "

2598,China: sectoral data,"Good data sources from China are hard to come by. For official data, you can find nearly all available data series through the company called CEIC, although this is somewhat expensive. In general, the history of many of these series doesn't go very far back either, since it is only in the last decade or two that China has really become serious about collecting economic data. If you want something that goes back to before 1990 or so, there are perhaps academic sources that do this (I don't know them), though this data will probably be based on very rough estimates in that case."
2599,Compensating variation versus change in value of goods consumed?,It wouldn't.  The value of consumer's endowments and the value after they trade should be the same.  i.e. Neither consumer becomes richer in terms of money.  They just allocate their money towards buying goods they value more.
2600,"Aggregate production function, factor shares and cointegration","Intuitively, you test for cointegration because if two variables are cointegrated, they represent only a ""one dimensional"" family of data points - even if you have a million data points from that sample, they will all fall close to the same subspace, and in general that will mean that you will have many values of parameters for your regression problem which will give a good fit (spurious regression)."

2609,What is the term for 'forgone cost' as 'opportunity cost' is for 'forgone profit'?,"The short answer: we don't need a separate term for ""foregone cost"", because opportunity cost of doing something = highest (forgone benefit - foregone cost)."
2610,When first differences contradict a regular regression regarding Investment vs Output relationship,"It's hard to say. Presumably you think you have some fixed (unobservable) omitted variables, which is why you ran fixed effects (FE) / first differences. So I see one of two things going on here:"
2611,What does it mean when the natural rate of unemployment is greater than the actual rate?,Natural unemployment is the 'expected equilibrium' rate. In the same way unemployment can go above the natural rate (usually when the economy is in a downturn) it can go below (usually when an economy is doing well).

Per time period, agent $A$ produces alone quantity of intermediate good $q_A$. Agent $B$, thorugh a company where it is shareholder, buys this quantity, the company inputs also some other intermediate good , say $q_B$, and the two together through a production function result in a final good quantity $(q_A,q_B) \to Q$. $Q$ is then bought by agent $A$ and agent $B$ as consumers, at price $P$. $PQ > p_Aq_A$ since it embodies a larger amount of productive resources (assume no inflation, which is not essential here)."

2616,Data Set/Database listing NAICS codes for U.S. firms?,"If NAICS are not provided in the dataset, you need a second variable, related to NAICS, to do the match. Two options are ISIC and SIC, related to industry classification. You can find the official link between these two and NAICS here.

2620,Effect of a subsidy on a monopoly,"The deadweight loss from the monopoly decreases. This is because the deadweight loss comes from the price being too high (higher than the marginal cost), which leads to not enough goods being consumed in equilibrium. Since the subsidy redices the price, the deadweight loss decreases. The subsidy itself does not increase the deadweight loss, because the only thing it does is reduce the price and there are no other effects. One issue may be that additional deadweight loss is caused by the taxes required to finance the subsidy. If these are lump-sum taxes then they do not affect the deadweight loss as they are non-distortionary and do not affect prices."
2621,Where is there more money: Bank Accounts or Brokerage Accounts?,"At the time of writing this answer, I would note that the question is somewhat confusing. The issue is that the question uses the common definition of the word ""money"" which corresponds to the term ""wealth"" in economics, while ""money"" has a narrow technical meaning (referring to the ""money supply aggregates"")."
2622,Useful software for notes and graphs in economics?,"I've been trying to find a solution for this same question.  As mentioned by others, most of the solutions are a bit too time consuming to do on the spot if you're taking notes, so I still think it's easier to draw out the graphs by hand on the spot.  "
2623,Why imports increase if higher relative inflation?,"At first, U.S. exports increase because US exports become cheaper due to the low inflation rate. Inflation itself only influences the exchange rate indirectly through its effect on supply and demand for currency. That effect goes through trade. For that to happen, trade must first take place and so US exports must first increase. "
2624,Specifying a Diff-In-Diff with multiple treated groups over multiple years,"Firstly, the diff-in-diff already is a fixed effects estimation. If you run a regression with FE and your time variant terms ($S_i*T_t$ and $T_t$) as in the plain and simple diff-in-diff setup, as such:"

2626,How do we estimate utility functions?,"One proxy for cardinal utility would be people's willingness to pay (WTP) for a particular product. One can estimate WTP using consumption data (e.g. from Amazon/eBay purchases), or elicit WTP using economic experiments. "
2627,How to handle change in base year of index?,"An alternative procedure would be to extrapolate the data for the most recent time backwards at the growth rate of the first set (earlier periods). By doing this, you do not have to rebase, adjust or splice the two sets. You will have the base year of the data for the most recent years (2004-5) and also will preserve the trend growth of the data for the earlier periods."
2628,Are strict dominance solvable games weakly dominance solvable?,"You're right. Let $s^*=(s_1^*,\dots,s_N^*)$ be the equilibrium of a strictly dominance solvable game. Then by definition, 
$$
u_i(s_i^*,s_{-i})>u_i(s_i,s_{-i})
$$
for all $i$, all $s_i\ne s_i^*$ and all $s_{-i}$. This implies that 
$$
u_i(s_i^*,s_{-i})\ge u_i(s_i,s_{-i})
$$
for all $i$, all $s_i\ne s_i^*$, all $s_{-i}$ and with strict inequality for at least some $s_i$ (in fact, for all $s_i\ne s_i^*$). This makes $s^*$ an equilibrium satisfying the weak dominance solvability criterion."

2652,What conditions must we demand for the economy to be always on the saddle path?,"To stick to the simpler deterministic case, it is perfect foresight and the Transvarsality condition (TVC)that guarantees that an optimizing agent will stay on the saddle-path, because all other paths lead to the violation of TVC (corner solutions violate the TVC).  In a deterministic environment and with perfect foresight the agent knows this and so he sticks to the saddle path.

2663,Who gets newly printed currency?,"One way to think about this is that money is put in circulation when the central bank buys assets from the citizens of a country. Sometimes this is really the main thing going on, for example, to perform QE the Fed bought all kinds of securities from financial markets. When the fed buys these securities it pays banks by increasing the deposit balances of those agents selling the asset."

Later, on, when the euro lost value, they no longer wanted to insure that the franc wasn't much stronger than the euro."
2666,How does Ricardo justify this math?,"Because in Ricardo's view, the money is neutral. The price reflects only the quantity of labor which is incorporated in the product. If it takes you 2 hours to hunt a deer and only 1 hour to hunt a rabbit then the deer will be two times more expensive. "
2667,Problem if Shareholder is a Director,"There is a potential conflict of interest (not only for a chairman but also for any director or employee who owns shares in the company) arising from the possibility of insider trading.  Suppose the chairman of a quoted company has a large shareholding and, through their position, becomes aware of information, not yet disclosed to the market, that means the company's prospects are not as good as previously believed.  They might then want to sell shares immediately, rather than waiting until the information has been disclosed and as a result the share price has fallen."
2668,What are examples of natural monopolies that don't have overwhelming economies of scale?,"One answer I found are natural monopolies that form on the basis of significant network effects. While economies of scale decrease the cost per unit as you can produce more units, network effects increase the value per unit as you sell more units. These two things together seem like they cover everything, but I haven't read any sources that mention whether there are other situations than economies of scale and network effects. Btw, I'm including ""economies of scope"" in my mention of economies of scale, since they're so similar."

Strictly speaking there is no way to calculate depreciation because the timing of capital formation is unknown, but capital begins depreciating as soon as it is formed."
2670,Are there stable improvements of the Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans model?,"The economic essence of saddle-path stability, is that it requires conscious behavior and decision making from the part of economic agents, in order for the system to remain on the saddle path. Simply put, we cannot do ""whatever we like"" and still expect the system to settle down. But that is what makes it interesting (and true to reality): on their own, economic systems are unstable."

2680,Can the cyclicality of the real wage be used as a measure for the degree of competiveness in the labour market?,"Let's be a bit formal. We are interested in modeling wage determination. For sake of brevity, I will skip some parts, also I will say nothing about how applicants and firms actually match. We want to see how their wages get formed, conditional on having matched."

2682,Why does having a single market price maximize quantity traded?,The competitive equilibrium price does not necessarily maximize the amount of goods produced. (The answer to your actual question ends here.)
2683,China causing Currency War,"Okay, in layman's words, devaluing yuan (against USD) means, Chinese made goods are cheaper in USD. On the other hand, American made goods are expensive in China as a result. China wants to keep its export competitiveness and may want to keep its 'world's factory' status. Well, South Korea may as well want to use a similar strategy to make domestically produced export goods competitive, similarly, other aisan governments considering devaluing their currencies. There would then be a currency war... hope this is as simple as you wanted to see."
2684,Are markets inherently short sighted?,"Of course markets can be shortsighted. The same problem can apply to any institution though. In order to correct a market failure using government it's necessary to appeal to the self interest of various interest groups, which may end up putting you back in square one."

2688,Removing a degree of freedom from relative utilitarianism,"One of the major criticisms you hear about classical economic frameworks is that ordinal utility is the only valid form of utility, because cardinal utility is just putting arbitrary numbers onto people's preferences. The thing is, cardinal utility is really not as fraught as heterodox schools (or even Austrian economists) might expect. Cardinal utility is only an expression of preference up to positive affine transformations, so as long as a utility function maintains the order of all the preferences, the utility functions represent the same preferences; cardinal utility just allows for us to express convexity/concavity along with it."
2689,Impact of a reduction of distortions in a flat consumption tax,"There is theoretical work on the matter in general. In fact, many standard models of optimal consumption taxation will typically yield a distortion that is increasing and convex in the rate of taxation. This means that increasing a tax on a good from 5% to 6% results in higher distortion than increasing it from 2% to 3%. Following this logic, it is better to tax many goods at a low rate than to tax few goods at a high rate, as the distortion would be smaller. This means that removing the exemptions (taxing goods with a currently lower rate of taxation than the rest) is better than increasing the tax rate on previously taxed goods (since they have a currently higher rate than the exempt goods). To conclude, it means that the distortion from taxing exempt goods, which would mean going from 0% to e.g. 20%  (assumed current VAT in Australia) is lower than going from 20% (current tax rate on non-exempt goods) to 40%, or so."

2695,Can holding interest rates at zero (ZIRP) for a very long time cause the deflation it is trying to prevent?,"While my answer would depend on how, why, and what the central bank said about why they pushed nominal interest rates to zero, I suspect in most situations the answer is no."
2696,Cointegration and imposing AR terms,"Johansen cointegration will usually yield more than one cointegrating vectors (cointegration regression coefficients). By definition, for a cointegrating vector, residuals must be stationary. And a stationary process can take any stationary ARMA form. So, adding AR term is cheating. What you shall do is to test for stationarity of residuals obtianed from cointegration vector. I do not mean to be rude, but you must be doing something wrong. Perhaps, your original variables are not I(1), or you need to include a determinsitc or stationary trend in your stationarity test, and the like. Just for comparison purposes, how do your Johansen results compare to Engel-Granger test. This might shed some light.

2700,How inflation affects exchange rates?,Consider two standard relations that tend to hold:
2701,Bank rate and Repo rate,"The Bank Rate / Discount rate is the interest rate charged by the central bank to member institutions for loans from the central bank. These are typically thought of as emergency funds to meet the liquidity needs of solvent banks with illiquid assets, thought since Bagehot to be properly set at a penalty rate to discourage abuse.* In contrast, the repo rate is the interest charged on repurchase / rehypothecation transactions, which are short term over-collateralized (e.g. \$100 collateral to borrow \$95) loans where a much larger set of institutions including banks, insurance companies, hedge funds, and others can participate on similar financial terms.

The microdata ""wage file"" as I call it and the ORG file as you call it only has information for the month for which the respondent was asked about wages.  The CPS is a timeseries only in the form of aggregated data. I do not know the study you are replicating so can't be more helpful.  Try adding what your objective is, e.g. I want to measure the wage differential of age groups in the XYZ industry/occupation or whatever.  My experience was in estimated the hourly wage distribution of workers in California."
2705,Demand for utility function given prices and budget,"Regarding the first question, @Oliv suggestion in the comments to formally write down the consumer's problem, budget constraint, Kunh-Tucker multipliers and all, and solve it (carefully -linear objective functions easily mislead when we are used to deal with non-linear ones), is the way to go in order to see how the mathematical set-up will lead you to the answer that stares you in the face:"
2706,What is the statistical program used in the Worldwide Governance Indicators?,"This isn't a matter of statistical packages as much as it is a matter of how to write a program to maximize/minimize a function. You can do this readily in Stata, Matlab, R, Python, etc. No matter what language you use, though, the process is basically the same. You write a function that specifies the functional form your trying to, say, minimize, set the parameters you're optimizing over as the function arguments, then call some built-in minimization routine on that function. Here is a primer for doing this in Stata and here is an introduction for R. Matlab and Python will both be very similar to R, with the primary exception being that you will have to declare the function in a different .m file for Matlab."

2715,"What are the main differences in a macroeconomic model, i.e. New-Keynesian DSGE, under a currency substitution (full dollarization) scheme?",You are not likely to find New Keynesian DSGE models where money or currency plays an explicit role. These models mostly abstract from these considerations altogether and monetary policy is simply represented by the interest rate. I understand your situation as I myself have tried to write papers and searched for literature where dollarization plays a role.

2717,Macro Economics Question: How will this curve shift?,"You can look at IS-LM models in order to understand the intuituion more deeply. 
In this graphic, IS curve shifts to left when there exists a demand-sided economic policy like government spendings etc. This will for sure increase the demand of people in economy, which will increase price levels.  If the price level increases, with the same quantity of money circulated in economy, the interest rate will increase. (you can see it on the graph) So, a central bank must control these kind of policies with a monetary policy in order to stabilize its inflation. "
2718,Can we have incomplete markets with a continuum of securities?,"Thanks a lot for the reference. I think the result does hold. Here is what I found:
The validity of such a law of large numbers what subject to some debate in the 1980s.

2719,Microeconomic foundation of discrete choice model,"Your first equation is an indirect utility function. The consumer chooses only one good and we assume that he can afford it. For simplification, the indirect utility discards the budget $m$ (often assumed be the same for all $i$).
Here, your demand function is perfectly inelastic. If the individual demand would not have been perfectly inelastic, the form would have been like $V=a-s(p)$, where $s'$ is strictly concave and increasing."
2720,Non-Constant Elasticity of Substitution,"Eichenbaum and Fisher (2005) follow Kimball (1995) in allowing for the possibility that the elasticity of demand is increasing in a firm’s price. Which is not exactly what I was looking for, but it's a start."
2721,Understanding the impact of Subprime Mortgages crisis on investment banking,"Simply put, you can't tell exactly. It's just not possible to tell these entities' subprime losses apart from other losses, with the possible exception of Lehman Brothers, due to the detail made available through its bankruptcy proceedings. Even then, it would be an incredibly labor-intensive task."
2722,Bubble and productive investments,I think one thing you can think of is this: 
2723,Delegation with Discreteness,"I believe this is the basic case discussed in the Laffont-Martimort textbook ""The Theory of Incentives"". The choice of the agent is either 0 or 1.

2727,Why does the profit reaches its maximum value at the equilibrium point?,"The point where MB = MC is the largest Net Benefit available for a given product.  Therefore, any additional benefit has a lower level of benefit than at equilibrium, and the costs increase at a higher rate than at equilibrium.  In the context of supply and demand, this is where the two lines cross.  But if you think about it in terms of diminishing marginal benefit, and increasing marginal costs then you can see why it is beneficial to product where the largest net benefit occurs."
2728,What is the effect of redirecting government tax intake to a consumer retirement saving incentive?,"If you've ever looked at the ratchet effects model, you might be able to glean insight from there? Basically, if a worker is paid in a piece rate $a + bq = S, for \space e(q)$, where e is the effort exerted by the worker, we know that it is the most efficient--normally--to set $b = 1$ (no deadweight loss of ""taxation"" of labor, so to speak), assuming that e is measurable. However, given the cost of effort, the firm will always try to guess what that ($C(e)$) is so that $a + be - C(e) = 0$, to minimize the salary $S$ that is paid out. Workers, anticipating this, ratchet their productivity downwards, since working hard will tell a firm that the job being done by the worker is very easy, and not worth much pay."
2729,How can I solve for total money spent if I use a non-constant MPC?,"I don't know that the distribution you claim is wrong but it strikes me as having a couple of very undesirable features. For one, virtually the entire population all of the has >0.99 MPC, which seems very high for a distribution you think is centered around 3/4. For another, if you think that the income shocks in your model are transitory rather than permanent, my reading of the literature is that these are way too large. But that's all separate from your question about estimating things conditional on the actual MPC distribution and ordering. "
2730,What to do for missing points in CPI time series?,"Statistical Analysis with Missing Data by Little and Rubin is the go-to reference for working with missing data, at least if nothing state of the art is required. In general, this is a complex problem that remains an area of active research. The relatively easy cases are when the data is missing-completely-at-random or missing-at-random. Even among the most basic single imputation methods you have a lot of choices (list from Little and Rubin):"
2731,What's is the purpose of “conditional preferences” as specified in Savage's framework?,"The statement $f\succcurlyeq f^\prime$ and for every $s$ not in $E$, $f(s)=f'(s)$ says that $f$ and $f^\prime$ have the consequences unless $E$ occurs, and $f$ is preferred to $f'$. Loosely, the sure thing principle says that if two acts differ only in their consequence should $E$ occur, their ordering should depend only on their consequences in $E$ and not on states outside of $E$. What the sure thing principle gets you is that if $f\succcurlyeq_E f^\prime$ then $f$ must be conditionally preferred to $f^\prime$ because of the consequences of $f^\prime$ in $E$. Otherwise this would not be known."

2737,Empirical tests for symmetry of cross-price elasticities,"Even if it is a very general result, its implications are not immediately intuitive and actually often quite difficult to accept. Why should the impact of an increase in the price for fresh strawberries on the demand for gasoline, be the same as the impact of a price increase for gasoline on the demand for fresh strawberries (while keeping $u$ constant) ?
One of the more convincing empirical investigation of Slutsky symmetry is experimental and provided in this paper which is also very closely related to the questions your ask:

2748,Do countries have to run on deficits? What is their possible economic future?,One of the main reasons for the general tendency to run deficits is political economy. Governments are elected for a limited period and try to stay in power by benefiting their electorate. An alternative explanation is that high debts reduce the scope for the subsequent government. So there are good reasons to impose some restrictions to the deficit into the constitution.

For GLS, I don't know what you mean by GLS, but if you mean the SUR estimator, then I see no reasons why inconsistent. The fact that $E(x_i' u_{i1}) \ne 0$ is irrelevant because $x_i$ is not a regressor in the first equation."

They show the validity of the contraction mapping theorem in a neighborhood of the exponential consumption path. "
2756,Why does local non satiation imply the constraint is binding?,"There are two situations with us when we know that preferences are locally non satiated. 
1) Preferences are monotonic - In this case we know that we have ""good"" goods which necessarily means that more of every good is better, and thus the consumer would want to exhaust his income 
2) Preferences are non monotonic - This permits the existence of ""bad"" goods but that doesn't mean that all goods are bad because that would mean that there is no bundle in the neighbourhood of origin (no good is consumed because all are bad) that is preferred to origin, thus we reach at a bliss/satiation point, violating LNS assumption. So, we need atleast one good which is not bad. In this case, the consumer would not spend anything on all the ""bad"" goods and exhaust his/her entire income on that one good which gives him/her positive utility."

2762,Dynamic optimization with assets as state variable: interpreting capital gains and losses,"Firstly, the $\lambda$ is by definition the shadow price of the wealth/capital. It is the price when you increase one unit of additional capital. $\lambda$ measures the rate of increase of the maximum value of the utility function as the constraint is relaxed. So, the dynamic equation of $\lambda$ is the change on this variable, which intuitively is the capital gain."
2763,Definition: Extractive Goods (Comtrades HS-Categorization),"I know this is a little late, (just joined this forum two hours ago) but if it is still relevant. You should look at the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade TRIEC system (Google ""DFAT TRIEC"") It is an established system and useful for high level groupings. You might try to use their groupings and hopefully be able to answer the questions from the analysis."
2764,What happens when I leave out empty cells in regression?,"When you have empty cells (and by empty cells, I assume that you are referring to a missing value of an observation specific variable), then STATA by default drops the entire row. So in a sense, even when you have a single missing value on a variable and you have say 100 variables, you lose the whole row (the entire observation). This is by default. If you want to avoid this, perhaps think about imputing the missing data points. "

2767,"Finding demand function given a utility min(x,y) function","No, you should not use Lagrange multipliers here, but sound thinking. Suppose $x\neq y$, say for concreteness $x<y$. Let $\epsilon=y-x$. Then $\min\{x,y\}=x=\min\{x,x\}=\min\{x,y-\epsilon\}.$
So the consumer could reduce her consumption of good 2, without being worse off. On the other hand for all $\delta>0$, we would have $\min\{x+\delta,y-\epsilon/2\}>x=\min\{x,y\}$, so the consumer could be better of by reducing the consumption of the second good and spending the freed money on the first good. In an optimum, a consumer cannot improve so optimality requires $x=y$. It is also clear that consumers improve along the $x=y$ 45° ray. So you can simply use $x=y$ as an optimality condition to be substituted into your budget constraint and bypass Lagrange multipliers."
2768,Solow model reparations,"No, savings is a structural parameter in the Solow model and is not affected by income level. The basic differential equation of the Solow model is given by     $$

2769,Correlation and Causality: Data comparison of educational spending and GDP growth,"Well, the obvious mistake, to summarize what other answers have hinted at, is that you mistake correlation with causation. All you have is evidence for the former, but you claim the latter. As you're too far to rethink what you're doing, the following won't help you much right now, but it's alternative ways to go in the future."
2770,Raising interest rates to prevent inflation,"The increase in interest rates make borrowing more expensive and therefore businesses and people will borrow less. Therefore, investment and consumption decrease. Through the multiplier effects, this will cause a reduction in real GDP. This will also increase the unemployment rate. Therefore, people who sell these goods and services will reduce their prices. As a result, the overall price level will fall and the inflation rate is reduced. I understand that explanation where the money demand decreases cause a probable eventual reduction in the interest rates. However, this assume that the money supply is fixed. Now, you must understand how the Fed controls the interest rates. It controls the interest rates by controlling the money supply. It reduces the money supply by selling bonds into the economy. Therefore, the money supply shift to the left and initially, the interest rates soar. The demand and supply analysis:"
2771,Changing the base year of Real GDP from 2001 Euros to 1990 Geary–Khamis dollars,"In general, real output is  calculated like this:
$$RGDP_{t, b} = NGDP_t \cdot p_{base} / p_t$$

"
2774,Can quantative easing be summarized as “The state prints cash to pay its debt to private sector”?,"Altough you are correct saying that the state ""own"" central banks, they should be independent from their government. This gives freedom to monetary policymakers from direct political or governmental influence in the conduct of policy."
2775,What is the effect on GDP when foreigners buy lots of domestic bonds?,"For every buyer there is a seller. If a foreigner buys a bond, that means a domestic investor sells it to them (or issuer). Why should the identity of who owns the bond matter?"
2776,GNI versus GNP for Measuring Development,"GNP measures production, so is a better measure of how the country is doing in the long term at accumulating fixed capital and developing. Fixed capital has a much higher return than the financial capital that GNI is typically derived from. However, both measures are usually very similar, except for some tax havens such as Ireland that have significantly more GNI than GNP."

2779,How does reverse repo rate affect money supply?,"Reverse Repo Rate (RRR) is the rate at which the central bank ""borrows"" money from commercial banks. (In practical terms it refers to the surplus funds that these commercial banks park with the central bank.)"
2780,"If the economy is not always on the Price setting curve, can the Central Bank target unemployment?","The role of the central bank is solely to enact monetary policy, not government (fiscal) policy. Monetary policy of the central bank is independent (in the legal and political sense) from government."
2781,Ordinal axiomatization of proportional division,The answer hinges on the level of 'atomicity' dictated by the problem. If the decision making unit is non atomic- i.e. can make infinitesmal decisions- then there is always an algorithm corresponding to the competitive allocation such that it is known also to be a 'cardinal' value allocation under certain conditions- vide Aumann & Shapley. However this would not be robust to even a small perturbation towards atomicity. My understanding is that this field is interesting because of how small changes in the lower limit to what is within the agent's decision making scope can lead to big changes in behavior
2782,Why are people rich?,"You have some incorrect ideas about wealth. First of all, inheriting money does not concentrate wealth, it disperses it. Usually the recipients of inheritances, both organizations and wayward children spend the money the receive so the inheritance is dispersed completely."
2783,Why does the Solow Model matter for undergraduate students?,I disagree that:
2784,Why isn't there an “ideal value” for a given currency? [closed],"Because money is really just arbitrary numbers, and those numbers only really have any meaning in relation to the other numbers in the set. For example:"
2785,Why does $\frac{MP_L}{MP_K} = \frac{w}{r}$?,"This is a result of firm maximization.  Consider a problem that a profit maximizing firm faces --it must rent capital, $k$, at rate $r$ and hires labor, $l$, at wage $w$ to produce goods ($F(k, l)$) for which we can sell at a normalized price of 1."
2786,How much to earn to break-even throughout life [closed],"Generally, only the top 1% pay significant taxes. Nearly half of taxes in the US are paid by the top 1% of taxpayers."

2788,Best resource to learn Microeconomics fast? [closed],"It would help a lot to know at what level this class is exactly. You mention calculus, however most classes titled like yours (""Introductory Microeconomics"") tend to be very light on math. I'm going to assume that your class is of the learning-introductory-concepts variety and not of the taking-partial-derivatives-to-maximize-utility variety. If I'm wrong please correct me (or ignore this answer)."
2789,what percentage of a banks money do they lend,"I'll put my comment as an answer and add one or two things. To see how much a bank lends in comparison to deposits, you can look at what is called the loan-to-deposit (LTD)ratio of banks in their annual reports. Usually it is between 60% and 90% but as you mentioned this can vary upon institutions .. And geographic areas as well ! For instance, in 2015 in the EU the average LTD ratio was 108% whereas in the US the average is about 79%. You can check per state the LTD ratio from data gathered by the Fed and the FDIC. "
2790,"Why do companies launch products at much higher prices, only to reduce the price drastically after a few months?",Two very general reasons are:
2791,How did we arrive to 40 hr work week?,The 40-week comes started with the movement of the 8h working day. The wikipedia article makes a quick summary of the historical progress of thinking from 12h work days in Britain during the industrial revolution to the nowadays 8h/day.
2792,What's the role of initial endowments in an edgeworth box?,"First, according to MWG, Def 15.B.1, ""a Walrasian (or competitive) equilibrium for an Edgeworth box exonomy is a price vector $p^\star$ and an allocation $x^\star = (x_1^\star, x_2^\star)$ in the Edgeworth box such that for $i=1,2$:"""

2794,Who determines the exchange rate and how?,"In many ways, it's no different to how any other price is set - by supply and demand. The only thing is, that because it's a transaction of money for money, there's some symmetry at play."
2795,Why don't most of the highly educated people in poorer part of Europe migrate to the Western part?,"There are numerous reasons why one would want to stay in a particular country even though earning power is lower.  These are usually summarized as ""frictions"" in the labor market."
2796,How can an outcome be Pareto efficient but not Kaldor-Hicks efficient?,"Example. Each month, God gives Adam $60$ apples and Eve $40$ (for a total of $100$ apples). Let's write this allocation as $X=(60,40)$."
2797,Quasilinear Preference and MRS,The MRS is a function of $x$ and $y$. The fact that $y$ doesn't appear in the formula simply means that this function is constant in $y$. 
2798,Analysis of free goods,"You can imagine a demand curve continuing through the x-axis as monetary price becomes negative. A negative price can be interpreted as payment to pick up shirts, a kind of subsidy.* That might tempt those who are still unwilling at price of zero because there's still a opportunity cost of picking up the shirt, or because they only wear collared shirts, or because disposal is not free (the unwanted shirt would need to recycled)."
2799,"Zero sum game, constant sum game","Suppose $(\sigma_1^*, \sigma_2^*)$ is the Nash Equilibrium of the game $G$ consisting of players $\{1,2\}$ having strategy sets $A_1$ and $A_2$ and the payoff functions $u_1:A_1\times A_2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and $u_2:A_1\times A_2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. Consider the game $G'$ in which everything else is same as $G$ except that the payoff functions are $v_1:A_1\times A_2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and $v_2:A_1\times A_2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ defined as: $v_1(a_1, a_2) = u_1(a_1, a_2) + d_1$ and $v_2(a_1, a_2) = u_2(a_1, a_2) + d_2$. We will now show that $(\sigma_1^*, \sigma_2^*)$ is also the Nash Equilibrium of $G'$. "
2800,Jokes in Economics; Challenging Assumptions in the Dismal Science [closed],Not to suggest that this should become a list of the best econ related https://xkcd.com/552/ and http://phdcomics.com/comics.php but I always really liked that one:
2801,Does unit elasticity has to be at exactly the middle of the demand curve?,"When the demand function is linear, $q = a-bp$, the only point were elasticity is unity is located in the midpoint of the demand curve (straight line). This is geometrical."
2802,Free alternative to EViews for ARIMA modelling,"The standard open source statistical language is R. The R-Project homepage is here. Here is a page about ARIMA in R. If you want to try using R without having to install anything, then I would recommend DataJoy, which provides a free web-based R environment."
2803,What is the need for a special purpose entity/vehicle in mortgage backed securities,Here are a few reasons that build on @Dismalscience's answer. 
2804,How is Regression different from Econometrics?,"To put it simply regression modeling is a technique, a tool, used by econometricians. Regression deals with dependence amongst variables within a model. But it cannot always imply causation."
2805,Why do central banks increase their rate to fight inflation?,From Monetary Policy:
2806,What at all justifies income taxes (as opposed to sales taxes only)?,"There's a fair amount to unpack in the question, so it might be useful to take it step by step, and consider everything from a more abstract, economic theory perspective."
2807,How can people save in a equilibrium economy?,The question is belied by some basic misconceptions. Just to list a few:
2808,"Public debt of European countries, by year","The IMF created its Historical Public Debt Database a few years back; that should do the trick for you. It's described in this paper, with annual data from 2012 back to as far as the late-1800s for some countries. You could pair that with the IMF/World Bank Quarterly Public Sector Debt statistics."
2809,When can I say that a utility function has constant marginal utility?,"Marginal utility (of $x$) in your case is $U_x(x,y)=2xy^2$. You use the sign of the derivative of MU, namely $U_{xx}$, to tell whether MU is increasing, constant, or decreasing. "
2810,How to derive utility function from indirect utility in this exercise [closed],"Use Roy's identity to find demand functions:
$$\displaystyle x_1=-\frac{\frac{\partial v}{\partial p_1}}{\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}} =-\frac{\alpha yp_1^{\alpha-1} p_2^\beta}{p_1^\alpha p_2^\beta}=-\frac{\alpha y }{p_1} $$"
2811,Is there any specific significance of inverse demand?,Inverse demand maps from quantity to value. It is useful to identify how much some units of the good are worth to the consumers. The central welfare concepts of consumer's and producer's surpluses rely on inverse functions in their definitions.
2812,Why do all countries recognize foreign wealth?,"Countries do not just stop recognizing foreign wealth because there are two kinds of wealth: real assets, and claims on the production of others; the values of both of these types of wealth are not determined by consensus, but rather by the use or pleasure one can derive from them. "
2813,Is economics Turing Complete?,"According to Vela Velupillai, Orthodox Economic Theory is not Turing Complete, because it is ""replete with uncomputabilites"". On this 2009's article he states:"
2814,Explaining why Hicksian demand is more inelastic to intermediate micro student,"Here's a ""no maths"" explanation (including the inferior goods case, because I think it helps to understand what's going on):"
2815,Why does competition work for capitalism?,When two companies produce commodities and/or services that are substitutes then they are simply producing for a market that allows the presence of two or more substitutes.
2816,Is the loan principal ever delivered in pieces over time?,"Handing out the principal amount of debt gradually, in increments, is standard practice in investment loans extended by a bank to a corporation.  "
2817,What assurances are there that the Federal Reserve does not give money to banks?,According to this official link
2818,Why do falling prices hurt debtors?,"If the borrower is a firm, lower prices means your output is selling for less, so you need to sell more units in order to repay the debt (assuming a constant profit margin)."
2819,"In this scenario, which coin is more valuable?","From the first equation,
$$100A_{1}=10B_{1}$$
so $A_{1}=0.1B_{1}$."
2820,Calculating Gini Coeffecient,All of these answers are true but don't provide an easy solution which doesn't use excel/code. Gini can be fairly easily computed by hand too.
2821,Are social goods and public goods the same thing?,I guess it might depend on the author. Here's another classification:
2822,What is the relation beween Granger causality and Rubin's causality?,"In short, not really.  Prof. John Cochrane offers an astute example of Granger causality by stating that a weatherman Granger-causes the weather.  We know that a weatherman has no measurable role in causing the weather, but there is indeed an intertemporal correlation between what the weatherman says today and what happens tomorrow."
2823,Big research goals in economics?,Yes there are. Two big ones are:
2824,understanding the proof of stochastic dominance.,That's just a question of notation. Note that
2825,Is any aspect of the cryptocurrency adoption violating a widely held economic tenet?,"Cryptocurrencies can be analysed from different perspectives: from the monetary perspective or from the asset & security perspective. The difference is: a digital asset is a good with some value which can be used/consumed for something, while currency is used as a store of value and mean of trade. I would say that currently is mostly being traded as an investment and not as currency, because it is bought to be sold for an higher price later, not to pay for goods and services."
2826,Economies of Scale explanation?,The short answer is that average costs fall because fixed costs get averaged across more units.
2827,Why are second price auctions preferred if they don't maximize expected revenue?,"I don't think sellers would prefer SPA over FPA. In fact, the SPA is riskier than the FPA, if we look at it from a seller's perspective. The reason is because the distribution of prices in case of the SPA is a mean preserving spread of the distribution of prices in FPA(you can refer to Vijay Krishna's Auction Theory for the proof). "
2828,Do the three ways of measuring producer’s surplus give the same result?,"Ask your teacher what he meant, because there is either a misunderstanding or he is mistaken. "
2829,How does tariff increase inflation?,"Foreign produced goods will see price increases directly as a result of the tariff, which adds to the prices of these goods.  The full tariff may not be passed through, as these higher prices will reduce demand, changing the supply/demand balance"
2830,Is printing money to pay government expenses regressive or progressive taxation?,"It rather depends on what happens to wages and interest rates, a ceteris paribus issue, and who you identify as ""rich"" or ""poor"": for example current workers borrowing to buy a house tend to be richer than the unemployed but poorer than those with large savings."
2831,Interpretation of lagrange multiplier,"As mentioned in the other answer, the Lagrange multiplier is the marginal effect on the value (optimized) function, when the constrained is ""relaxed"" marginally. In your case then it should be interpreted ""how much studying time changes as the required average expected grade..."" increases?"
2832,How to create a Budget line in excel or R,Another R code that does it...
2833,Dynamic optimisation,"The Dynamic Programming (""Bellman' Equation"") formulation incorporates the terminal boundary condition (""transversality conditions"") needed in case we use the Lagrangian/Euler equation formulation. The initial conditions are still needed in both approaches. "
2834,Why isn't the “annihilator” matrix a zero matrix?,"The inverse of some matrix $X$, $X^{-1}$, is defined for square matrices only (i.e. when $X$ has the same number of rows and columns). In the typical econometric applications, the data matrix $X$ usually has far more rows (observations) than columns (regressors). Formally speaking, the matrix $X$ in your definition of $M$ has dimension $n\times k$ but $n\ne k$ (actually $n\gg k$), and so it's not a square matrix. "
2835,Negative Gini Coefficiente?,"tl;dr No, it is not possible to have a negative Gini coefficient."
2836,Are Cobb Douglas goods complements or substitutes?,"Start with the more general CES function  $U=[a*x^b+(1-a)*y^b]^{1/b}$. Compute the elasticity of substitution of this function. Then compute the functional form of U for $b=0$,$b=1$ and $b=-\infty$. You will find the two extreme (perfect complements / substitute) cases for CES, and the common case C-D for b=0."
2837,"Martingale, random walk and rational expectations",All concepts are used in Economics. Definitions (not stated in a fully rigorous manner):
2838,Why does the IMF push for austerity?,Why do so many people die in hospitals? Aren't doctors there supoosed to save lives?
2839,How does the Federal Reserve unwind the asset purchasing scheme announced in response to the 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic?,The unwind depends upon what the central bank did.
2840,Is the price-quantity diagram fundamentally wrong?,"The graph you've depicted is just very generic supply and demand intersection, under the generic/introductory assumption that an equilibrium price exists. "
2841,What is the maximum number of characters in a currency symbol?,"Instead of currency symbols, some of which are used by more than one currency as @HotLicks suggests, you may want to consider the three-letter currency codes used in most currency exchanges. Here is a list: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217#Active_codes."
2842,Present value heuristics problem,"Well, when $r$ is zero, you are just getting value $A$ per time unit, so total present value will be $A \cdot t$."
2843,"How are workers harmed, from firms' payroll tax revenue aimed at reducing workers' tax?",I attached three figures. Figure 1 shows the labor market without the tax. You can see the surplus that the firms and workers receive. They enjoy a surplus because some labor would be hired at even higher wages and some labor would be willing to work at lower wages. The sum of these surpluses gives the 'welfare' of the actors in the labor market.
2844,"Is it possible to give, in economics, an example of a relation ( set of ordered pairs) that is not a function?","I feel that your question might be a little broad, but there are certainly many areas of economics where non-functional relations are used. Two simple examples (there are many others):"
2845,Is wealth inequality actually a problem,"I think that you are more or less than correct in thinking that cash that is never spent (nor expected to be) may as well not exist. Thought experiment: suppose that, unbeknownst to you and everyone else, £1 million suddenly appears under your mattress. If you never discover the money, it is hard to see how it could change anything in a meaningful way."
2846,Profit Function: Just revenue maximization subject to constraint? if so where is $\lambda$?,"The problem
$$\max py(x) $$
$$s.t. wx \leq \bar{C} $$
could be interpreted as revenue maximization subject to an operational budget contraint. However the solution of this can differ from the solution of the profit maximization problem, as costs do not appear in the goal function. $\lambda$ here would show by how much an additional dollar spent on operational costs would increase profits. If $y$ is strictly increasing in $x$ the entire budget would be spent even when $\lambda < 1$. However with such a low $\lambda$ a dollar spent earns less than a dollar, so it should not be spent if the goal is to maximize profits."
2847,How do small firms survive in an oligopoly?,"When there are few big firms and many smaller firms with a small market share, economists speak about a market with a competitive fringe. The smaller firms are price takers, have higher marginal and average costs and a lower markup than bigger firms. They have often a lower rate of profit than big firms. Although markets with heterogeneous firms are often not presented in textbooks, the economic literature is full with contributions investigating heterogenous firms. This is more realistic, but somewhat more complicated than the homogenous firm framework. Existence and unicity of the short- and long-run equilibrium are not always guaranteed.
Small firms survive because they have often smaller sunk costs (entry and exit costs) than larger firms, and often pay lower wages."
2848,Basic New Keynesian Model: Why variables are defined by integral equations,"First of all, this is not something special to ""the basic New Keynesian Model"". It is a commonly used technique when modeling an economy with competitive environment."
2849,How was the CES production function derived?,"The CES function can be derived directly from the condition of constant elasticity of substitution.  There are various ways to do this, but the simplest derivation occurs for a homothetic production function.  Suppose we start with a homothetic production function $Q = f^*(K, L)$ and we rewrite this in intensive form as:"
2850,How to determine which triangle is DWL?,Here's a quick and dirty trick: 
2851,Interpetation of coefficent in AR(1) model,"For a second-order stationary series it is the correlation coefficient between the dependent value and its lag.
Specify
$$y_{t+1} = a+ \beta y_t + u_{t+1}\qquad u_{t+1}= \text{white noise}$$"
2852,"Do banks really have people on the boards of corporations, and why?","What you describe is neither unusual nor pernicious, and occurs more commonly at smaller companies when the company has borrowed significantly from a single bank. Larger companies have direct access to capital markets (in addition to stock, they can issue bonds and commercial paper, which are both forms of debt), and are thus less reliant on their relationship with a single bank."
2853,Is there something that does not change its value that can be used to measure currency inflation?,TL;DR -- No
2854,Mathematical derivation of the Production Possibility Frontier,"The question is broad, but I believe there is plenty of literature that defines this concept in similarly broad terms.
The following is adapted from the Wikipedia on Pareto Efficiency,
which is the mathematical basis of the Production Possibilities Frontier."
2855,(Evolutionary Game Theory) Argue informally there can no longer be an ESS in which only b is played,"The ""secret handshake"" idea was first formalized in economics by Robson (1990)."
2856,Monopoly and Taxes (Nicholson Exercise),"First let's look at the specific tax. The profit is
$$\pi_s=[P(q)-\tau_s]q-C(q).$$
Differentiating to establish the first-order condition:
$$P'(q)q+P(q)-\tau_s-C'(q)=0.$$
If we write $A=\tau_s q$ for the tax revenue then we can rewrite the FOC thus:
$$P'(q)q+P(q)-C'(q)=\frac{A}{q}.$$"
2857,Can the major indice of an exporting nation decrease at the same time the currency devalues?,"Your question, as I understand it, is: can a nation's currency and a nation's stock index decline in value simultaneously. The answer is yes and I think the best way to show this is with an actual example: "
2858,Who owns the federal reserve?,"The Federal Reserve is a system, consisting of the reserve banks, which are ""owned"" (in a limited fashion) by their member banks (members select the leadership of the reserve banks), and the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, which oversees the member banks and is independent within the government (that is, the Governors are nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, but neither has direct control over the Board beyond its composition and the legal authorities assigned to it). All of this is covered in the law that gives the Fed its authorities, the Federal Reserve Act. "
2859,Does the marginal product need to be diminishing to have a diminishing average product?,"Suppose the total product is given by $f(x)$. Thus, the average product is $$AP(x)=\frac{f(x)}{x}.$$"
2860,Which area of Economics involves heavy mathematics and also appears to be directly helping the people?,Some ideas based on the course list:
2861,Application of Intermediate Value Theorem for General Equilibrium,"A stronger hint: Write $p_2=1-p_1$, so that $Z(p)=Z(p_1,1-p_1)$. Use the conditions $Z_1(0,1)>0,Z_1(1,0)<0$ etc. and the intermediate value theorem to argue that there exists a $p_1^*\in(0,1)$ such that $Z_1(p_1^*,1-p_1^*)=0$. "
2862,What are accepted econometric methods to find out if a time series is I1 or not?,"An I(1) series is also known as a series with a unit root. Therefore, the econometric tests to inquire on the order of integration of a time-series are referred to as ""unit-root tests""."
2863,Labor as a commodity,"So in modern English, a commodity is a raw material for production or basic agricultural good that can be exchanged for money. Labor, by this definition, is neither a raw material, no one grinds humans up to build stuff, I hope; an agricultural good, similar reasoning; nor exchangeable for money, as slavery and indentured servitude is illegal and efficient in most places. (Letting people make their own work decisions, or at least not forcing them to work, is good, generally speaking.)"
2864,Returns to scale - Constant Function,You want to find a relation between $tF(z)$ and $F(tz)$ for all $t>1$ (or $0$ for CRS). 
2865,How do I adjust for inflation?,First it would be about the index used to take account inflation.
2866,How do penny auctions make money? [closed],"In a penny auction, each bid raises the going price of an object by just one penny. However, placing such a bid is costly whether or not you win. Usually it costs one dollar to place a bid -- sometimes this is obfuscated by making you purchase bids (or bidding credits) before you participate. In any case, if the opening bid of an auction for something is 0.01, and the auction ends with the price at just 10, then one thousand bids have been placed and therefore the site has made 1,000 on top of what the item actually sells for (10). So if the item has a value of 500, then they would represent that as 98% discount even though they actually made a profit of 510, simply because they ignore the bidding costs (their primary source of profit)."
2867,Do house prices increases affect inflation?,Here's what the Bureau of Labor Statistics' FAQ has to say on CPI and housing costs:
2868,Investment and probability,The simplest thing is to calculate the expected cost in the two scenarios:
2869,Access to the markets for a country,When a country loses access to markets they mean access to debt markets. Here is a quote from a paper if you need a citation:
2870,Is worsening wealth inequality intrinsic to Capitalism?,"While the owners of a successful business will generally experience an exponential growth compared to their employees, there are some factors to consider:"
2871,"Diagram with axes $r$ and $S,I$","It was Alfred Marshall's doing, but based on a premise that still prevails in many parts of Economics: if prices are assumed totally elastic, then, although it may be the case that they are taken as given by the individual buyers or sellers, at market level it is quantity that determines price. So price is indeed the dependent variable, if you care about the market and not about the individual.  "
2872,Is the basic RBC model a weak model?,"A model is an abstraction of reality, to explain a part of it. A model is weak when it cannot explain what it's supposed to be explaining. Just adding features to a model has no intrinsic good. It's much different from a fruit salad, where usually, an increased variety in fruits will lead to a better taste. Here, adding more features makes it hard to understand which feature of the model was necessary to generate the result observed."
2873,How is monetary policy fair in the current economy? [closed],"The description you're providing of how interest works is based on a couple of fairly common misunderstandings about how the system actually works, so lets clear that up first."
2874,Who owns German debt?,"This is at the same time 1) a little old and 2) provides a deeper and more general answer that what you might be looking for, but I would still encourage you to go through it. "
2875,What does a central bank guarantee against its currency?,"Most central banks do not provide guarantees on their currency to the public.  In fact it can be argued that historically they were never fully guaranteed as most central banks issued more receipts for gold (or other assets) than they had, so the receipts were never fully redeemable in the aggregate.  "
2876,When can the fiscal multiplier be negative?,"The paper How Big (Small?) are Fiscal Multipliers? by Ethan Ilzetzki, Enrique G. Mendoza, Carlos A. Végh (2010)should give you useful information."
2877,What's the term for consumers not being able to pay their mortgage?,"Not paying a mortgage is first known as delinquency (when payments are missed) and later, default (when the loan is written down and the lender seeks foreclosure). But an inability to pay has no particular term of art attached to it, because an inability to pay can arise either out of illiquidity (debts exceed liquid assets) or insolvency (debts exceed liquid assets and ability to borrow against future income)."
2878,Does Dogecoin or Bitcoin have a more appropriate rate of monetary inflation?,"First, we need to set straight that you have a critical error in your supposition: The rate of creation of money is not the only determinant of the inflation rate, see here."
2879,"In Indonesia, reducing fuel subsidy strongly impacts the price of everyday goods. Why?","Consumers rarely have to pay the full price of petrol / gasoline. That's true in most of the world, and the US is no exception. There are explicit subsidies and favourable tax regimes in many extraction countries; and of course there are the implicit subsidies in the unpriced pollution - oil's externalities."
2880,Is income inequality decreasing? [closed],Here is a fairly instructive figure showing a cross-country measure of income inequality:
2881,What is the real reason for china's stock market crash (August 2015)?,"Stock prices predominantly are a quantification of the company's future growth and profit prospects. These are expectations, and are partly based on how the specific company performs currently and has performed in the recent past, but also on what the ""general economic outlook"" looks like (expectations again): if it is ""gloomy"", we expect that this will constrain even the best of companies."
2882,What are the books usually called for studying the computation of GDP?,The ultimate reference is the UN's SNA 2008 manual. SNA stands for System of National Accounts. The SNA 2008 is the international statistical standard for the national accounts
2883,How do I calculate quantity to minimize long-run average total cost?,Your are right. You have to minimize the average cost.
2884,Typical Farming Economics Resource,I don't have many books to share but there is the website on Farm economy data from the USDA.
2885,Competitive vs complete and non-competitive vs incomplete marekts,"Complete market is a market where every possible asset or good can be assigned a price and where you have perfect information, can make perfect contracts and zero transaction costs. Any market can be complete regardless of its market structure. So you can have complete market dominated by monopoly, or oligopoly or monopolistic competition etc."
2886,What is the difference between trade deficit and current account deficit?,They are very related concepts but they are not completely same.
2887,The government is issuing massive debt for coronavirus relief - why aren't interest rates rising?,One standard way of determining the fair value of a bond yield (for a country that controls the currency it borrows in) is to say that it is the sum of two factors.
2888,Information and search,"The solution concept of Bayes Correlated Equilibrium applies to games, viz strategic interactions, between multiple players. Thus, in a single person decision problem its use seems to me inappropriate or at least superfluous. A lot of effort has been spent over the last 70 years (dating back at least to Blackwell 1951, 1953) to explore the notion of information and information structures in decision problems. In that literature lies your answer."
2889,Sequential Game is Extensive form game?,"First of all, you can differentiate between static (essentially all players move simultaneously and only once) and dynamic (essentially non-static) games."

2891,How do I calculate the services sector as a percentage of GDP?,"The table you are looking at is a GDP expenditure measure.  But this ignores the fact that services are involved in the costs of goods purchased, and that goods are involved in the cost of services purchased.

Likewise, situations, where someone does not like one of these goods or has very strong substitutions patterns between a pair of goods, are also ruled out.  All preferences are assumed well-behaved (monotonic and strictly convex). "

2912,Do wages differ in two perfectly competitive labour markets?,"This will typically depend on if people can switch between the two markets. If switching is possible then the marginal worker has to be indifferent between working in market A and market B and this equalizes the wages in the two markets. This also assumes you mean wage rates and not wage bills. Wage bills also depend on hours worked per worker, and that decision need not be equal across industries because of sorting and other reasons. "
2913,What's good about both exports and imports of a country rising at the same time?,"There are plenty of issues that can be relevant here, which mean it is hard to give a precise answer. On the one hand, even though GDP is not growing, at least the balance of trade is roughly unchanged. Some countries could experience an equivalent unaffected change in GDP via a trade deficit (e.g. if part of the fall in net imports is compensated with, say, an increase in consumption), which can fuel a currency depreciation and create inflationary pressures, not only on imported goods but on locally produced good which use imported inputs."

With such an income level, the problem of inflation does not crop up really. 
However, basic income might have other serious problems with crowding out due to large government spending and the disincentive to work and hence loss of productivity. "

2919,Interest rate rule in monetary DSGE model,"I've just solved this problem. First of all, your solution does not make too much sense, as in a simple interest rate rule it must hold that the sum of all coefficients must be greater than one. In your case this means that $\phi>1$. Therefore, the series would converge not to zero. Second, an interest rate rule should try to offset fluctuations. This means that the central bank should try to offset gaps from its target (like in the task). Try instead the following interest rate rule. 
\begin{equation}
i_t=\rho+\phi_{\pi}(\pi_t-\pi)+\sigma(\Delta y_{t+1})+\pi
\end{equation}
Now what is the idea? Assmung that the output does not change, this term is zero. Using the Fisherian $i_t=r_t+\mathbb{E}_t\{\pi_{t+1}\}$ we get
\begin{equation}
\rho+\phi_{\pi}(\pi_t-\pi)+\sigma(\Delta y_{t+1})+\pi \overset{!}{=}r_t+\mathbb{E}_t\{\pi_{t+1}\}
\end{equation}
which can be summarized as
\begin{equation}
\phi_{\pi}^{-1}\left(r_t-\rho+\mathbb{E}_t{\bar{\pi}_{t+1}}-\sigma(\Delta y_{t+1})\right)=\bar{\pi}_t,
\end{equation}
where $\bar{\pi}_t=\pi_t-\pi$. 
Solving forward yields 
\begin{equation}
\bar{\pi}_t=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\phi_{\pi}^{-(k+1)}\mathbb{E}_t\{r_{t+k}-\rho-\sigma\Delta y_{t+1+k}\}
\end{equation}
Notice that for $|\phi_{\pi}|>1$, the series converges. However, your log-linearized Euler equation can be rearranged such that it holds that $r_t=\rho+\sigma\mathbb{E}_t{\Delta y_{t+1}}$. Finally, this can be plugged into $\bar{\pi}_t$ such that $\bar{\pi}_t=0 \quad \forall t$. Notice that this expression finally is your answer, as $\bar{\pi}_t=\pi_t-\pi=0$ means that the central bank always achieves its target. "

2921,Homothetic preferences and weak separability,"EDIT: Seems to that after your most recent edit the answer is still no. 
A relatively simple counterexample is:
$$
U(x,y,z) = \sqrt{x} + \sqrt{y} + \sqrt{z}.
$$
This is clearly seperable and homothetic. But $D_z$ is is not independent of $p_x$ and $p_y$. I think this is clear just by looking at the utility function, as it is not of the Cobb-Douglas type. If you have doubts you can calculate $D_z$ from these equations:
\begin{eqnarray*}
MRS_{xz}(x,y,z) & = & \sqrt{\frac{z}{x}} = \frac{p_x}{p_z} \\
\\
MRS_{yz}(x,y,z) & = & \sqrt{\frac{z}{y}} = \frac{p_y}{p_z} \\
\\
m & = & p_x \cdot x + p_y \cdot y + p_z \cdot z.
\end{eqnarray*}
Then
\begin{eqnarray*}
m & = & p_x \cdot x + p_y \cdot y + p_z \cdot z \\
\\
m & = & p_x \cdot z \cdot \left(\frac{p_z}{p_x}\right)^2 + p_y \cdot z \cdot \left(\frac{p_z}{p_y}\right)^2 + p_z \cdot z \\
\\
\frac{m}{p_z}\frac{1}{\frac{p_z}{p_x} + \frac{p_z}{p_y} + \frac{p_z}{p_z}} & = & z.
\end{eqnarray*}
As you can see both $p_x$ and $p_y$ appear."
2922,Economic Confirmation Biases,"Confirmation bias is somewhat different to the behavior you are describing. This expression describes the attitude of a researcher who interprets ambiguous data as confirming his initial hypothesis.

2926,Mathematical analysis of Marginal Cost,"I think you're getting things backwards. Marginal cost (at a certain quantity $q_0$) really only makes sense as the derivative of the total cost function with respect to quantity at point $q_0$:
$$
MC(q_0)=\frac{dTC(q_0)}{dq}.
$$
The interpretation of marginal cost as ""the cost of producing the last unit of output or the cost of producing the next unit of output"" is based on the (linear) approximation 
$$
\widehat{MC}^+(q_0)\approx\frac{TC(q_0+1)-TC(q_0)}{(q_0+1)-q_0}\quad\text{or}\quad
\widehat{MC}^-(q_0)\approx\frac{TC(q_0)-TC(q_0-1)}{q_0-(q_0-1)}
$$
This interpretation is usually introduced in undergraduate textbooks because of its intuitive appeal, not for its mathematical rigor. Imagine trying to explain the concept of marginal cost as the cost associated with an infinitesimal amount of change in quantity to a freshman who probably has no idea what ""infinitesimal"" means, let alone the concept of derivative.

2928,What is the purpose of interest?,"Interest is a key mechanism to ensure that resources are properly allocated within an economy. There are lots of uses to which money can be put: consuming goods, building highways, constructing a new factory, investing to develop a new drug, etc. Just like goods, the allocation of money is governed by the price system—where the interest rate is the price (because the interest rate is how much you have to pay to get access to money). If the price is too low (i.e. if there is no interest) then few people will be willing to lend money and valuable investments (in, for example, infrastructure or new business ventures) will not take place because the funds aren't available to pay for them. A positive interest rate ensures that people with money they don't need right now have an incentive to lend it to people with valuable projects to fund."

2933,Why is perfect price inelasticity of demand not considered an exception to the law of demand?,"Because although some goods have perfect inelasticity over some interval, they are not perfectly inelastic over the whole demand curve - over the rest of the curve, quantity and demand will be strictly inversely related. And the law of demand doesn't have a ""strictly"" in there. Price and quantity are inversely related, but not strictly so, which (in the mathematical sense) means that parts of the demand curve are allowed to be perfectly inelastic."
2934,Why is AC = MC in the monopoly?,"Suppose the marginal cost is constant and equal to $c$, that fixed costs are $K>0$, and that revenue is $R(q)$. You seem to understand that MR=MC must be true for profits to be maximized: $R'(q)=c$. We also know that average costs are given by $AC=(K+qc)/q$. But note that $AC=(K+qc)/q>c=MC$. Thus, when profits are maximized we have $AC>MC=R'(q)$. So it is not true that $AC=MC$ when profits are maximized in this example. We can conclude that $AC=MC=R'(q)$ holds only in certain special cases."

Let us assume a production function, F, with inputs of capital, K, and labor and technology, AL. Thus, output, $Y = F(K,AL)$. Assuming constant returns to scale, i.e. $F(cK,cAL) = cF(K,AL)$, we can say $F(K,AL) = ALF(K/AL, 1)$. The intensive form of the production function, f, takes the argument k = K/AL. k is ratio of capital to labour, or how much capital is there per effective unit of labour. $f(k) = Y/AL = F(K/AL, 1)$, or the output per effective unit of labour."

So if the willingness to pay is infinite as you correctly asserted, then the consumer surplus is also infinite. See my answer to this question."
2945,Is UK house price spiral connected to debt based monetary system?,"The price of housesis determined by the supply and demand for housing. The consensus view is that house prices in the UK are so high because of low supply and buoyant demand. In particular, the UK is currently building houses at a rate of less than 150,000 per year, but is creating twice that many new households. This is a situation that has persisted for some time. If there are more buyers than sellers then sellers can increase their prices with little fear that they will be left without a buyer at the end of the day."
2946,Are debt/GDP ratios calculated with real or nominal GDP as the denominator?,"Usually, the debt/gdp ratio has no unit. For instance, if the debt is equal to 60% of the gdp, the debt/gdp ratio is 0.6. If you use real gdp as denominator and nominal debt as numerator, you end up with a number which is less clear to interpret. It is more relevant to have either both variables in nominal terms or both in real terms. In these two cases, the result is the same."
2947,"Why do firms bother to produce at equilibrium quantities if at equilibrium quantity, MR < MC?","The MC curve can only be seen as a supply schedule for the individual firm if it is a price taker. In the case you depicted, however, we have imperfect competition. A profit-maximizing firm will thus produce where MR=MC, and charge a price that will induce consumers to purchase this quantity (which can be read off the demand schedule). In this sense, there is no ""disequilibrium"": the firm is doing the best it can (so it has no reason to change), and total quantity demanded is equal to total quantity supplied (i.e. there is market equilibrium).

Kydland and Prescott (1977) argue that a central bank should follow defined policy rules instead of active stabilization methods because the latter contributes to economic instability. Barro and Gordon (1983) prove that under a discretionary regime, the central bank has an incentive to print money to improve the economic performance in the short run, but this doesn't happen in the long run. Walsh (1995) discuss the way central bankers incentives should be design in order for the central bank to follow a socially optimal policy."
2954,What does 'Health spending as a share of GDP' mean?,Healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP is the measure of spending relative to the value of entire nations output at market prices in a given year. I suppose you can call the total output the value of the economy so you could say that although note that economy is a wider concept that would normally include things omitted by GDP which can only measure transactions for which there are market prices (hence economic activity such as housework and other non-market transactions are excluded).

where $p_X > 0$, $p_Y > 0$ and $U \geq 0$ are given.
Since prices are positive, the cost minimizing choice will satisfy the condition that $x + 3y = U$. So, we can rewrite the above problem as :
\begin{eqnarray*} \min_{x\geq 0, y\geq 0} & \ \ p_Xx + p_Yy \\ \text{s.t.}& \ \ x + 3y = U \end{eqnarray*}
We can now substitute the value of $y = \frac{U-x}{3}$ in the objective and rewrite the problem as :

 Now we are interested in returns to scale, which is the change in output due to the multiplication of every input with a constant. We can write: $x_{1i}=ax_i$, for every x where a is a constant and the subscript 1 means the new x due to the multiplication. It follows that: 
 $\Delta x =x_{1i}-x_i =ax_i-x_i=(a-1)x_i$
 Substitute this last result into the total differential. We obtain:
$\Delta Q = \sum_{i=1}^{\ k}\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x_i}\ (a-1)x_i$
  which can be rewritten as
$\Delta Q = (a-1)\sum_{i=1}^{\ k}\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x_i}\ x_i $
 Now recall that the output elasticity with respect to an input i can be written as
$\epsilon\ = \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x_i}\ \frac{x_i}{\ Q}$
rewrite this to the expression
$\epsilon\ Q = \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x_i}\ x_i$ "

2985,Proof that utility is nonincreasing in prices,"That follows $v(p_1,y)$ being the highest utility one can get from a bundle affordable given prices $p_1$ and income $y$. Let $x_1$ be such a utility maximizing bundle. Then $p_1\cdot x_1\le y$ and $u(x_1)\ge u(x)$ for all $x$ such that $p_1\cdot x\le y$. In particular, $u(x_1)\ge u(x_0)$ since $p_1\cdot x_0\le y$ (this is what the argument you have shows.) Therefore,
$$v(p_1,y)=u(x_1)\geq u(x_0)=v(p_0,y).$$
Intuitively, if prices are lower, one can buy from a richer set of options, and with more options one can always get at least as high utility."

2990,How is bartering (goods for goods) conceptually related to trading (goods for money) and monetary (money for money) exchange?,"Consider an economy where there are $N$ goods and assets. How do you purchase a good? If $n \cdot (n-1)$ forms of exchange are possible because all $n$ goods can be all other $n-1$ goods then this is a barter economy. If there is only a single good that can be exchanged for all other goods then only $n-1$ forms of exchange are possible then this is a monetary economy where that single good is ""money"". See, for example,  Kiyotaki and Wright (1993). Used this way, Trade Equilibrium $\supset$ Barter Equilibrium $\cup$ Monetary Equilibrium. A no trade equilibrium is sometimes called autarky. "

It is treated as exogenous. The result found by the OP says that, if the saving rate $s$ is set equal to the capital share of income $a$, then it will so happen that the steady state capital will be equal to the golden rule capital."

2996,Does SARP imply WARP? and GARP imply SARP?,"Yes, SARP implies WARP. Since all choices are singletons under SARP, we abuse notation and write $C$ as a function that takes alternatives as values.
We prove the contrapositive, every violation of WARP in a setting where choices are unique give rise to a violation of SARP. So assume there are sets $B$, $B'$ containing $x$ and $y$ such that $c(B)=x$ and $C(B')=y$. Letting $B_1=B$ and $B_2=B'$, you get a direct violation of SARP (I take it you require $x_i\neq x_{i+1}$ in the definition of SARP)."

However, your demand curve is continuous and the usual assumption in microeconomics is that you can consume any amount of this good, for instance $1.478926574$ units. Thus, your first calculation for the surplus is not correct, the correct way to do it is"

3011,What makes statistics economical reports so varied and different?,"Regarding the general question in the title, the reasons why ""the same"" variable vary across sources depends very much on the particular variable you are talking about. Personally, one of my first shocks when I started working after my undergraduate was the high number of ways the same conceptual variable studied theoretically (e.g. inflation) could be measured in practice. These alternative definitions might refer to slightly different phenomena, or might reflect different set of assumptions by those computing the statistics. Depending on your ontological position when it comes to economic concepts (e.g. is there such a thing as ""inflation"" out there?), you can argue that some assumptions are better than others. But this does not deny the fact that there are potentially many ways to measure the same variable, and different institutions/individual might prefer one over the other."
3012,Modelling Bounded Utility Functions,There are many such utility functions. Most commonly: 
3013,Beliefs about equilibrium paths with overlapping strategies,"This is a common source of misunderstanding with regards to the concept of equilibrium. The specification of an equilibrium (at least in the standard theory of a one shot games) is agnostic about how the players figured out they are in that equilibrium, and, by definition, assumes players know the ex-ante strategies of their opponents.

Differential topology is still used in general equilibrium theory, you might take a look at recent work of Yves Balasko. "

3029,Is the Trans Pacific Partnership good or bad for the U.S?,"I think economists consensus is that on average and in the medium run, free trade will benefit people in both countries. However, it has also become pretty clear that free trade hurts some people quite badly in the short run because they'll lose their jobs and possibly won't find new ones. It has also become pretty clear, that even though in theory you could put policies in place that help people and places that are hurt by trade at the expense of those who benefit from it, this is almost never done in practice. If you are for more or less free trade depends largely on what weights you apply to this trade-off."

3031,Why does the European Union give subsidies to farmers?,"Markets are extremely poor at pricing events that have very low probability and catastrophic impacts. In part because we're very bad at estimating low-probability events: by definition, they're rare. And in part because the catastrophic impacts fall on pretty much all the population, so any single purchase has very widely-spread potential negative externalities."
3032,Is poverty rightly measured internationally?,"This measure of poverty depends on your definition of basic needs and local prices. Argentina is a good example for how local prices matter. It is widely accepted that official price and inflation statistics published by the Argentinian government are cooked and inflation rates in the last few years are have been substantially bigger than official numbers suggest. I assume that the world bank has to rely on those statistics and it is therefore likely that its  estimates of poverty in Argentina are too low, simply because the price level adjustment is not done with good data."

In a Vickrey auction, it is a Nash equilibrium for everyone to bid their valuations. This is stronger than a Bayesian Nash equilibrium, which is the solution concept in Bayesian games (which include auctions). The Bayesian Nash equilibrium is the solution concept in which every player seeks to maximize their expected utilities, subject to their respective beliefs about the world. In the Vickrey auction, agents' beliefs about the world do not really matter."
3043,What is the difference between comma and plus in the bellman equation?,"You should be careful about the way you wrote your two equations because the $\max$ operators are different. In the first equation, you maximize an objective function on a set, meaning you look for the best value of $y$ given that $y$ belongs to a known set. You did not define this set. In the second case, you choose the maximum among two values. Contrary to the first equation, $y$ is predefined and is not a parameter to find given your notations."

This can be very convenient and in the United States is sometimes required. In addition, some regulated firms like banks are required to prepare documents on calendar quarters regardless of the month of their fiscal year end, and it is often cheaper and easier to have them be synchronized rather than close the books additionally for regulators.

In other words, nominal interest rates will always adjust such that real interest rates stay at whatever the market rate is. Hence, if inflation rises, then nominal interest rates must rise. Which brings us to the first point of confusion..."

That is, your belief about others' types or strategies does not matter."
3115,How does key currency work?,"The demand for a key currency, like the USD - in contrast with other national currencies - is based not only on the domestic economy, but the global word economy. As the USA is viewed as a superpower and a global leader in economy, accordingly the US currency is generally viewed as a stable monetary asset which can be used as a global currency in international trade, or a clearing unit in international transfers and a value safeguard.
Some other currencies are tied to the value of the USD as well, which makes global trade much more calculable. As a result of this collective perception, the demand does not depend that much on the US economy, but the global economy and other global processes. This is obviously beneficial for the US economy and government as well, as it has much more wiggle room in becoming burdened with debts, while able to keep the value of its currency."

However, in general, we do not wish to make these assumptions. (For example, assuming that $t_{-i}$ is independent of $a_i$ conditional on $\theta$ and $t_i$ means that the mediator cannot reveal any additional information about other players' types once they have revealed the state to a player.

3149,Proof for homogeneity of elasticities,"Note that the Marshallian demand function $x^*(p_x,p_y,I)$ is homogeneous degree zero in $(p_x,p_y,I)$ (see here for a proof). According to Euler's theorem for homogeneous function, it follows that 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial x^*}{\partial p_x}p_x+\frac{\partial x^*}{\partial p_y}p_y+\frac{\partial x^*}{\partial I}I=0\cdot x(p_x,p_y,I)=0
\end{equation}
Dividing both sides by $x^*$, you have 
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial x^*}{\partial p_x}\frac{p_x}{x^*}+\frac{\partial x^*}{\partial p_y}\frac{p_y}{x^*}+\frac{\partial x^*}{\partial I}\frac{I}{x^*}&=0\\

The quasi linear utility function
$$
U(x,y) = v(x) + y

\begin{align*}
|MRS(x,y)| & = p_x \\
\\
v'(x) & = p_x \\

Electronics would otherwise be implemented with simpler digital/analog circuits. Currently, the path of least resistance is to just use a CPU for practically everything. For example, cars have plenty of embedded CPUs, whereas back in the 1970s, many might have been almost entirely analog circuits (the radio being the only possible exception)."
3169,Show that First order conditions are necessary and sufficient for utility maximization,"Consider the following situation :
Preferences of the consumer are represented by the utility function $u(x_1, x_2) = x_1 + x_2$. Note that preferences are strictly monotonic and convex. Now let income be any $y > 2$. So the consumer's problem is :
\begin{eqnarray*} \max_{x_1, x_2} & x_1 + x_2 \\ \text{s.t.} &  \ \ 2\sqrt{x_1} + x_2 \leq y \\ & x_1\geq 0, \ x_2 \geq 0 \end{eqnarray*}
Now let us set up the Lagrangian :

Here are the first order necessary conditions:
\begin{eqnarray*} \dfrac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial x_1} & = & 1 - \dfrac{\lambda}{\sqrt{x_1}} + \mu_1= 0 \\ \dfrac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial x_2} & = & 1 - \lambda + \mu_2= 0 \\ \dfrac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial \lambda} & = & y -2\sqrt{x_1} - x_2  \geq 0, \ \lambda\geq 0, \ \lambda(2\sqrt{x_1} + x_2 - y) = 0 \\ \dfrac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial \mu_1} & = & x_1  \geq 0, \ \mu_1\geq 0, \ \mu_1x_1 = 0 \\ \dfrac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial \mu_2} & = & x_2  \geq 0, \ \mu_2\geq 0, \ \mu_2x_2 = 0 \end{eqnarray*}"

3181,Wealth transfer by Social Planner in GE,"We have an allocation $(x^*,y^*)$ and a price system $p$ forming a price equilibrium with transfers.The assignment of wealth levels $(w_1,\ldots,w_I)$ has to satisfy $$\sum_i w_i=p\cdot\bar{\omega}+\sum_j p\cdot y_j^*.$$
One way to interpret the wealth levels is that the planner hands out coupons that can be traded at existing prices for commodities and chooses the production plans of the economy. But one can interpret the wealth distribution also as a distribution of the initial endowments and of firm shares. Let $w=\sum_i w_i$ and for each consumer $i$, let $m_i=w_i/w$, which is just the share consumer $i$ has in the aggregate wealth. Now give each consumer an endowment $\omega_i$ of $m_i \bar{\omega}$ and for each firm $j$ a share $\theta_{ij}$ equal to $m_i$. For the resulting private ownership economy, $(x^*,y^*)$ and $p$ constitute a Walrasian equilibrium, so one has reduced redistributing wealth to redistributing endowments and shares in firms. To see that everything works out, note that
$$w_i=m_i w=m_i\bigg(p\cdot\bar{\omega}+\sum_j p\cdot y^*_j\bigg)=p\cdot m_i\bar{w}+\sum_j m_i p\cdot y_j^*=p\cdot \omega_i+\sum_j\theta_{ij} p\cdot y_j^*.$$"

I start by offering {A, B}, and you take A. Then I offer C as well, and also let you trade B for A so long as you give up some arbitrarily small amount of utility denoted dx. This means that your options are {A, (B-dx), C}, where dx is some arbitrarily small amount of utility that you will lose which is chosen so as to not change your opinion that B-dx is better than A. As a result you choose B-dx instead of A. The result is that you have given up utility for no benefit -- you could originally have chosen B originally, but instead took B-dx -- i.e. that you have been Dutch booked. "
3184,Can the Fed control the shape of the entire yield curve?,"Yes, and they don't need any ""unconventional"" policy tools to do this, all they need to do is precommit to a future path of short-term nominal interest rates which they will maintain no matter what. The reason that in practice the Fed is unable to control the long end of the yield curve is because the Fed is not an institution which precommits to these kinds of policies - their policy decisions are always contingent on the information available at the date they take the decision, which means bond investors will try to forecast Fed funds rate movements not by looking at what the Fed says they will do in the future, but by forecasting the relevant macroeconomic variables that enter the Fed's decision process and thinking about how the Fed will react to what they expect will happen. Long-term bond yields reflect investors' future short-term nominal interest rate expectations, and by Fisher you may split that into inflation and real interest rates, so inflation expectations are a part of it, but they are not the whole story. Could the Fed set the entire yield curve to zero? Sure, if it could convince investors that it would maintain a zero interest rate policy for 30 years."

3192,"Why is there Ricardian equivalence in Ramsey's model, but not in OLG?","Ricardian equivalence essentially means the timing of taxation doesn’t matter. Ramsey models are typically infinitely lived agent (or can be formulated as such) models with no heterogeneity. OLG models have age heterogeneity, so if people live for k periods an agent born in period 0 receiving a transfer in period t < k to be financed by a tax in period t+j, t+j > k, they don’t live to face the tax and the transfer is a permanent increase in income. Similarly, a person born in period k does not receive the transfer and views the tax as a permanent decrease in income. In an infinitely lived agent model (here a Ramsey model), the agent will always live to see both the transfer and the tax."

higher-quality general labor and capital input, better managerial practice/talent, or better information technology. See the JEL survey about What Determines Productivity?"

3210,Expectations in Gali's classical monetary model,"As for your first question, we are not just assuming $\partial U/\partial B > 0$. We simply assume monotonicity of preferences, which for the model here is a plausible condition. In simple terms this means that ""more is better"". Hence, the consumer will always choose to spend all of his budget for current or future consumption, given by $C$ and $B$ respectively. Hence, the constraint holds with equality. In these types of models we pretty much always assume equality of the budget constraint."

3218,"Let the utility function $U = a + b \min\{x,y\}$. Are $x$ and $y$ perfect complements?","Consider a typical car, which is made of one car-body (for lack of a better word) and four tires. Let $x_1$ denote the number of car-bodies and $x_2$ denote the number of tires. Most consumers would prefer cars in the form of one car-body with four tires, and not in any other combinations. So we may represent their preference as 
$$U(x_1,x_2)=\min\{4x_1,x_2\}.\tag{1}$$
Thus two cars are preferred to one car can be expressed as 
$$
(2,8)\succ(1,4)\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad U(2,8)=8>4=U(1,4). \tag{2}
$$
One car with two extra tires does not increase one's utility:
$$
(1,4)\sim(1,6)\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad U(1,4)=4=4=U(1,6).  \tag{3}
$$
Equation $(1)$ is the utility function associated with a perfect complement preference. In particular, it is a special case of the general form $\min\{ax_1,bx_2\}$ where $a=4$ and $b=1$. "
3219,Natural real interest rate and output gap,"Regarding you first question, the answer is 'yes', at least in your model. For if the real interest rate, $r_t=i_t-E_t\pi_{t+1}$, is equal to its natural level $r^n_t$, then in your model $x_t=E_tx_{t+1}$ and $x_t=0$ for all $t$ is a solution which is consistent with the dynamic equation. (Note that other solutions are consistent with the dynamic equation in the case $r_t=r^n_t$ for all $t$, such as $x_t=1$ for all $t$.) "

3236,Can there be sensible choice behavior that violates the Weak Axiom of Revealed Preference?,"I think that your example relies on a misunderstanding of the meaning of the choice function. $C(\{x,y,z\})$ does not contain the elements that the decision-maker would choose simultaneously if he could. He is only allowed to select one element at a time (otherwise, why not consuming all three items ?). Therefore $C(\{x,y,z\}=\{y,z\}$ does not mean that he selects both shoes. It means that, if you ask him to choose one element inside $\{x,y,z\}$, he might either pick $y$ or pick $z$, being indifferent between the two. In that case, your story would not make much sense, since the value of a single shoe would be the same in both choice sets."
3237,Slope of a production function,"The (partial) derivative of a continuous function is defined as

\frac{\partial F(\overline K, L)}{\partial L} := \lim_{\Delta L \to 0}\frac{F(\overline K, L + \Delta L) - F(\overline K, L)}{\Delta L}.
\end{align}
Now if $L \in \mathbb{N}$, then you have a lower bound for the increment $\mathbb{N} \ni \Delta L \geq 1$. Otherwise the definition above is not well defined for $\Delta L = 0$.
Such that we finally arrive at the approximation
 \begin{align}
\frac{\partial F(\overline K, L)}{\partial L} \approx \frac{F(\overline K, L + 1) - F(\overline K, L)}{1}.

3238,Preferences exhibiting local nonsatiation,"Since we are working in $\mathbb{R}_+$ you can't go below (0,0). So consider the point (0,0). Are we guaranteed a point around it that is preferred? So using the notation you used, let $(x_1,x_2)=(0,0)$, then any other point $(y_1,y_2)$ where $y_1$ or $y_2$ is positive will be worse than $(0,0)$. So we have a satiation point at $(0,0)$. "

3252,Classification of Two-Person Games,"If you look at generic games, that is games where players are not indifferent between any choices such a classification is easy to produce. Let the strategy sets be
$$
S_1 = \left\{a,b\right\}, S_2 = \left\{c,d\right\}
$$
and let the utility/payoff functions be denoted by $U_1$ and $U_2$.  
The characterization will be based on the dynamics of the game, that is given a strategy profile $(s_1,s_2)$ will any player wish to alther his strategy. This will also give you all the equilibria. Without loss of generality you can assume
$$
U_1(a,c) > U_1(b,c).
$$
(Should this not hold, switch the labels of the strategies $a$ and $b$.) 
 We still need to know if player 1 prefers $(a,d)$ to $(b,d)$ or vice versa, and also if player 2 prefers $(a,c)$ to $(a,d)$ and if he prefers $(b,c)$ to $(b,d)$. This gives eight possible combinations which will characterize the game classes. (But due to symmetry actually there will only be four classes.)"
3253,How much money was distributed during quantative easing?,"The easiest way to estimate the total amount of quantitative easing is to look at the change in the balance-sheet of the Federal Reserve because every bit of money put in through quantitative easing involved the purchase of assets which grew the central bank's balance sheet.

3265,Has the “dismal theorem” practical implications?,"My conclusion based on reading his paper is that the utility function of an individual or society can't be of the CRRA form presented in the paper. That would indeed lead to scenarios where you could not get out of the bed in the morning, as minimizing the tiniest probability of an enormous risk would warrant infinite sum of money."
3266,Pure Exchange Economy,"As you note in your question the (inner points of the) Pareto set are defined by
$$
x_1^1 = \frac{\alpha_1 r^1 x_1^2}{\alpha_1 x_1^2 - \alpha_2 x_1^2 + \alpha_2 r^2}
$$
In order to better examine this curve, let us treat it as a function. Let
$$
f(x) = \frac{\alpha_1 r^1 x}{\alpha_1 x - \alpha_2 x + \alpha_2 r^2}.
$$
As I stated in my comment
$$
f(0) = 0 \mbox{ and } f(r^2) = r^1,
$$
so the set indeed goes from one corner to the other. In between you have
$$
\frac{d \ f(x)}{d x} = \frac{\alpha_1\alpha_2r^1r^2}{\left(\alpha_1 x - \alpha_2 x + \alpha_2 r^2\right)^2}
$$
and
$$
\frac{d^2 f(x)}{dx^2} = 2 \cdot \frac{(\alpha_1\alpha_2r^1r^2) \cdot (\alpha_2-\alpha_1)}{\left(\alpha_1 x - \alpha_2 x + \alpha_2 r^2\right)^3}.
$$
The first derivative is always positive because $r^2 > x$ and all other parameters are positive. For the same reason, the sign of the second derivative depends on the sign of $\alpha_2-\alpha_1$.  Thus the Pareto set will be a strictly increasing curve, which is convex if agent 2 values good 1 'relatively more', concave if agent 1 values good 1 'relatively more', and a straight line if they value it 'relatively equally'."

3276,"Decreasing Costs, Increasing Returns to Scale, & C''(q)","Second derivative of cost function is actually the first derivative of marginal cost function. i.e. 
$$
\frac{\partial^2C(q)}{\partial q^2} =\frac{\partial}{\partial q}\frac{\partial C(q)}{\partial q}=\frac{\partial}{\partial q}MC(q)
$$
Now if $\frac{\partial^2C(q)}{\partial q^2}<0$, this means that marginal cost is decreasing in output. If marginal cost is decreasing then that implies that firm's average cost is decreasing and hence it exhibits increasing returns to scale. "

Disclaimer that I am responding directly to your Thai example, and not talking about economics of storage. Rice can be safely stored for a period of time, and it is in the United States. Many developing countries struggle with proper storage of grain. For example, the World Bank estimates that 10-20% of South Saharan Africa's grain crop is lost to spoilage each year, roughly equivalent the amount of grain that they import yearly which can feed 48 million people.

3280,Uniqueness of utilities in competitive equilibrium,"A sufficient but perhaps not necessary condition would be if the demand functions of all consumers were decreasing in price. (Price ratio to be exact.) This would cause the aggregate demand to be decreasing in price, and since the aggregate supply is constant there could only be one equilibrium price.  If there is only one equilibrim price then for each consumer there is only one utility maximization problem and it has a maximum.
 Denote by $\omega_m$ the initial endowment of good $m$. Let $e$ denote the income derived from the initial endowments given the prices, so $e = p_x\cdot \omega_x + p_y\cdot \omega_y$ Then the condition would be
$$
\frac{d \ x(p_x,p_y,e)}{d \ p_x}
=
\frac{\partial x(p_x,p_y,e)}{\partial p_x} + \frac{\partial x(p_x,p_y,e)}{\partial e} \cdot \frac{d \ (p_x\cdot \omega_x + p_y\cdot \omega_y)}{d \ p_x}

3281,"If strict convexity of indifference curves isn't assumed, does MRS have to be negative?","If one of the goods is not beneficial and the other is then the slope of the indifference curve will be positive and hence the MRS negative. This is becuase

MRS(x,y) = - \frac{MU_x(x,y)}{MU_y(x,y)},

There will likely be further patterns. What do you see? Does the variability stay constant over time (likely when you have percentages) or is there a tendency for the variability to grow?

It doesn't mean that inflation is still occurring. In fact, you could be experiencing deflation after a period of inflation and if prices today are still higher than the base year, have the deflator be above 100. A growing deflator is an indication of inflation. To detect inflation acceleration you'd need to see changes in the log(deflator) growing over time. "

The meaning of ""High elasticity "" and ""Low elasticity"" in Figure 2 is that the steeper line has a much lower magnitude of elasticity than the flater line at the same quantity level."
3316,Does Efficient Market Hypothesis make anticipated monetary policies useless?,"We begin our story at time $t-1$, where we have a Goldilocks economy (not too hot nor too cold). At time $t$, the economy gets worse. At time $t+1$, it becomes obvious that the central bank will cut the policy rate by 25 basis points at the next meeting and that this is sufficient to move the economy back to where it was at $t-1$. At time $t+2$, the central bank cuts the policy rate by 25 basis points. If markets are semi-strong efficient and the worsening of the economy is public information (along with the monetary policy action), then we would expect stocks to fall on $t$, rise on $t+1$ to the same level as $t-1$, and be unchanged on $t+2$ (assuming nothing else is happening in the economy). "
3317,Probit with panel data - assumptions violated with endogenous covariate?,"Yes it does.

This will help you study the seller's actions in the first period since they will lead to different scenarios in the second one. In fact, saying ""the subgame perfect pricing policy is set p1 = 1199 and p2 = 299"" is not a valid statement, the subgame perfect policy should be of the form: "" the seller chooses p1=number in the first period and p2= a function of which players remain in the market"""

3327,Are CPI stats weighed based on population size,"Yes, the data is weighted based on the population size of the area from which it came. The survey designers employ a method called stratified random sampling, which ensures that the prices of goods selected for the sample are distributed across all areas (rather than by chance landing up concentrated in a few areas). Then, the prices in each stratum are assigned a sampling weight, the ratio of size of the population in that stratum to the number of prices collected in that stratum. Those weights are used when calculating the mean price for that item (i.e. multiply each observation by its weight, divide by the sum of the sampling weights)."

3329,Do policy functions exist for Finite Horizon Dynamic programming problems?,"No, they cannot by definition.
To derive a time-invariant policy function, you need to have an infinite horizon problem. This is because the structure of the solution remains the same, no matter when you look at it. Intuitively, this is because any sequence of periods from any time period to infinity looks the same. The technical conditions for this can be found in a number of textbooks (Adda and Cooper, Sargent, as well as Stokey/Lucas)."

3337,Why's it always better to choose a lump sum than periodic payments over time?,"To be viable as a 'good' choice, the period payments must total to an amount that is equal to or greater than what could be achieved by taking the lump sum and doing something with it. In practice, this means that a period payment must total to a larger amount than the lump sum payment, with the difference increasing as the total amount of time of payments does."
3338,"If saving equals investment, can there ever be a stock of savings?","The accounting identity assumes that anything saved is an investment, i.e. something will be done with that saving in the future. It's a bit circular, I know. It's not a lagged model, i.e. there's no explicit indexing by time of the variables, unlike (e.g.) in the Hansen–Samuelson model, which uses discrete time. There are also macroeconomic models with continuous time, e.g. Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans model."
3339,Definition of subgame perfect Nash equilibrium,"An equilibrium consists of a profile of strategies, which specifies an action for every player at each possible contingency. Since each action profile $(a_1,a_2)$ is a contingency, the SPE must include functions $a^*_3(a_1,a_2), a^*_4(a_1,a_2)$ that specifies what to do at those contingencies. "
3340,Why is elasticity not constant on a straight line graph?,"Theoretically, the responsiveness of quantity demanded is different at different prices. Take the equation for the elasticity of demand:
$$\epsilon_{D}=\frac{\Delta{Q}}{\Delta{P}}\frac{P}{Q}$$
The equation itself is non-constant as it depends on P and Q. Lets assume a linear demand curve with the simple form: $P(Q)=6-Q$. If we take an equal change in price, say $\Delta{P}=1$, and since the demand curve is linear in this case, we see it has a slope = $-1$ and thus the $\Delta{Q}=1$. If we have two situations where $P=5$ and $P=4$, then, to keep in accordance with our slope, lets say $Q=1$ and $Q=2$, respectively.
The two elasticities of demand for these two prices would be $\epsilon_{D}=5$ and $\epsilon_{D}=2$ for the higher and lower price respectively."
3341,Plotting the isoquant curves,"Each curve shows the rate at which K can be substituted for L, or vice versa, while keeping output constant. The Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution (MRTS) equals the absolute value of the slope. The MRTS tells us how much one input a firm can sacrifice while still mainting a certain output level. Then the MRTS is equal to the following ratio: $$\frac{\text{Marginal Productivity of Capital } (MP_{K})}{\text{Marginal Productivity of Labour } (MP_{L})}$$"

So a Nash equilibrium can easily be Pareto sub-optimal (or Pareto inefficient), which means that it is possible to one player can be made better off without making at least one player worse off. However, ""The interesting thing about the prisoner’s dilemma is that all options are Pareto optimal except for the unique equilibrium, which is for both to defect."" "

3351,What impact would introducing 15 times more soy worldwide do to the price of soy?,"Roberts and Schlenker (2013) estimate the price elasticity of demand for agricultural commodities to be about -0.08 to -0.05. These are elasticities estimated over much smaller changes in $p$ and $q$ than you are suggesting. Remember that the elasticity is effectively percent change in $q$ for a percent change in $p$, so we can ask what the percent change in $p$ is for a percent change in $q$. "
3352,Imperfect Substitutes and Utility Funcitions,"In general, any utility function that produces non-linear and downward sloping indifference curves will feature imperfect substitutability between goods. (By considering only goods, we're implicitly assuming ""more is preferred to less"", or positive marginal utility, for each good.) In other words, look at the marginal rate of substitution and see if it depends on the quantity of either good; if it does, then there is imperfect substitutability. "
3353,"For a certain good, if there is a one-time fixed cost for a consumer to switch to a different firm, then this good is? [closed]",The good has a switching cost / is subject to a switching cost. Rarely used: it is a Diamond good. (Referring to the Diamond 1971 paper.)

(i) why did you implicitly exclude the case $a^i(\textbf{p})=0$?
(ii) if your individual is rational then $v^i$ is homogeneous of degree zero in $(\textbf{p},w^i)$ which has implications on $a^i$ and $b^i$... Your demand system should also satisfy the budget constraint (adding-up)."

3357,Elasticity of Supply for a Monopolist,"Elastic with respect to which variable?
Contrary to what is said in some bachelor textbooks, the monopoly has a supply curve, but it cannot directly be seen on the MR=MC Figure. 
As the price is endogenous in the case of monopoly, the price elasticity of supply is not defined, unless you have some exogenous variable shifting the price. For instance if the inverse output demand function is $p=P(y,z)$ where $z$ denotes an exogenous variable (population size, aggregate unemployment rate, etc), then it is possible to compute the elasticity, even in the case of a monopoly. Then you can compare the responsiveness to shifts to $z$ in both the competitive and the monopoly cases. At the monopoly optimum, the condition $$P(y,z)+\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}(y,z)y=c'(y)$$ implicitly defines the supply function $y^*(z)$ and it can be shown by the implicite function theorem that $$\frac{\partial y^*}{\partial z}(z)=-\frac{\partial P/\partial z +y^*\partial^2P/\partial y\partial z}{2\partial P/\partial y+y^*\partial^2P/\partial y^2-c''},$$ where for simplicity I omitted the arguments of the different functions. From the second order condition for an optimum, we know that the denominator is negative. It turns out that for demand shifts $z$ which increase $P$ the monopoly output increases (provided the term $y^*\partial^2P/\partial y\partial z$ is well behaved, if $P$ is linear in $z$ for instance).  In the competitive case, the comparable expression is $$\frac{\partial y^c}{\partial z}(z)=\frac{\partial P/\partial z }{c''},$$ which is positive as well. Now compare both expressions, and conclude…. As we are interested in elasticities, we should actually compare $$\frac{\partial y^*}{\partial z}\frac{z}{y^*}(z) \text{ and } \frac{\partial y^c}{\partial z}\frac{z}{y^c}(z),$$ and consider that $y^*>y^c$. If the inverse demand is linear, comparison is easy, but is involved in general as it depends on global properties of all functions involved in the expressions above."

3359,Why hyper-inflation?,"This is a common misunderstanding of central banking.  The popular media portrays things as if the act of increasing interest rates prevents hyperinflation.  In truth, ""preventing inflation"" and higher interest rates are both side effects of restraining the growth of the money supply.  "
3360,Cournot duopoly with differing costs,"I think the missing link for you is not realizing that $Q$ is actually equal to $q_1 + q_2$: in a duopoly, quantity demanded can only be derived for the two firms in question. With that in mind, we can rewrite the profit functions for both firms in terms of $q_1$ and $q_2$ and then optimize with respect to the $q$'s accordingly (since Cournot competition is competition over quantities). We are then going to be left with two best response functions, one that tells you the optimal level of $q_1$ as a function of $q_2$ and another that tells you the optimal level of $q_2$ as a function of $q_1$. Then it just becomes an algebra problem to find the Nash equilibrium and the relationship of quantities and profits between the firms will become clear."
3361,What are “the fundamental categories of economics”?,Cost covers all the inputs you mentioned and markets don't need to exist. Rent seeking is a perfectly valid alternatives to markets. So having to choose (cost/spend) between different alternatives (profit) is all there is. You can even include time as a cost and reduce it to two factors.
3362,Yield curve flattening- abstract question,"If an investor has a fixed amount to invest for a given time horizon, then a longer-term bond locks in the current long-term bond interest rate, but a short-term bond only provides this rate for a short time. After that, the short-term interest rate may be more or less favourable. Apparently the investors expect that the short-term rate will become less favourable for them after the current short-term bonds mature. "
3363,preference relations and monotonic transformations of utillity functions,"Depending onhow one reads the question, the converse holds either always or basically never. Let $u:X\to\mathbb{R}$ and $v:X\to\mathbb{R}$ be arbitrary functions with ranges $u(X)$ and $v(X)$, respectively. It is not hard to show that $u$ and $v$ represent the same preferences if and only if there exists a strictly increasing function $h:v(X)\to\mathbb{R}$ such that $u=h\circ v$. So this is the ""always""-answer."
3364,Concave utility functions corner solution explanation,"Intuitively, one can see that the corner solutions lie on the highest possible indifference curve(for concave preferences).

The most common one is called ""open market operations (omo)"", which is basically selling/buying government securities to/from private individuals or organizations. Through these operations, central bank affects the level of cash reserves in the banking system since it deposits/withdraws payments for these government securities to/from the banking system. When cash reserves in the banks go up -by central bank buying government securities-, these banks decrease their interest rate to deplete the extra added cash reserves, and the vice-versa."

3403,Empirical measurements of consumption and production elasticity of substitution?,"The elasticity of substitution of production factors derived from empirical data depends on the data. In the case of simple production, you can estimate the production function (fit your data to the functional form of the production function) and from it derive the elasticity of substitution and other functional parameters.
The elasticity of substitution in the case of a production function (accounting for output) has it's roots in the classical consumption function (accounting for utility), as you mention.
Empirical studies are plenty and the numerical results vary depending on country, industry (aggregate level) or type of company (micro level). However, the robustness of the results may not be up to par, because aggregate (and otherwise), especially neoclassical, production functions are subject to numerous restrictions and assumptions.

3405,Ban an import that is exported,"In general, no, it can't impose stricter rules on imports than it does on domestic production. Or more accurately, it could, but the countries exporting fur to Norway could challenge this. The guiding rule is that domestic industry cannot receive preferential treatment over importers."
3406,Why is there a deadweight loss in this lemons market?,You can calculate the total social surplus (= CS + PS) in this equilibrium and compare it to the social surplus in the efficient allocation of cars. 
3407,Income Elasticity of Demand vs. shift in demand curve,Short answer:
3408,"In panel data application, when using Fama and MacBeth regression is preferable over the fixed or random effect model? thought","I cannot precisely answer your questions because I do not know which exactly regressions you want to perform as @jmbejara says and which papers are you referring to that use Fama-MacBeth regression. Are they on financial or other literatures? I haven't seen Fama-MacBeth on other literatures (I do not follow any other literature to be exact), so please post the papers. Obviously, if in other literatures one can justify the analogy of the risk-premia concept, Fama-MacBeth can be applied there, too."
3409,What amount of share buy-backs are legitimate?,"If the company has excess cash or excess liquidity that it cannot effectively deploy in capital investments, and it has reason to believe that the expected value of returns from purchasing shares will be higher than alternatives (such as buying equities or financial instruments), this would be legitimate, where ""legitimate"" can be defined as an increase in the long-term value for anyone holding shares in the company."
3410,Currency Value Formula,"This is a difficult question in that it is very difficult to prove that something is impossible. However, based on the types of analysis done in financial markets, estimating supply and demand curves is obviously difficult to do."
3411,It's unclear how market equilibrium is reached in case of overproduction,"The Econ 101 demand-and-supply story serves to illustrate a simple point: Markets tend to move/adjust towards equilibrium. However, such adjustment is neither instantaneous nor perfect; rather, it takes time."
3412,Testing for Endogeneity,"(i) I think your idea makes sense. Under the null, $[X,Z]$ is orthogonal to $\varepsilon$. Under the alternative, $X$ is correlated with $\varepsilon$. (ii) Your statement that it's ""basically a test of whether the OLS residual are orthogonal to $Z$"" is exactly what I think. (iii) Your thought about the power depending on the relevance of $Z$ also makes sense. If $Z$ is irrelevant, then the moment restrictions $E[Z_i' (y_i - \alpha - X_i \beta)] = 0$ hold for any $\beta$ (due to the uncorrelatedness of $Z_i$ and $X_i$) so the OLS residuals should appear to be uncorrelated with the instruments although the OLS estimator is inconsistent. I think this test is closely related with standard methods explained below, although I have not done any derivation in this regard."

3415,Supply and Demand: Why should lower costs lead to a rise in supply?,"You can think about this using the basic theory of the firm that we teach in principles courses, such as this one.  The specifics of the graph will change depending on the assumptions of the market it represents (perfect competition, monopoly, etc), but the story should be the same."

I guess the parts in Ch. 8 that discuss hedonic wage theory would be most relevant to your inquiry. "
3421,Do institutions buy debt with credit?,"This is extremely common in institutional markets, and is called a ""repo"" transaction - short for Repurchase agreement"
3422,Discrete returns versus log-returns,"I would say people usually use log-returns for continuous data (although no data is really continuous, not even tick data). And discrete returns when your data is discrete. In the case of GDP, you only get the data every 3 months, so that is as discrete as it gets. "

3427,Growth Accounting with variable factor shares,"Interesting question. In effect, while factor shares were thought to have remained fairly stable over a long time (the first of the Kaldor's facts), more recently they have varied, particularly in the direction of a fall in the labour share."
3428,Looking for an article in Behavioral Economics about Inequality,"Although your description is very detailed, there is plenty of research on this topic. I think you are looking for this current published paper:"

3432,Stone-Geary preferences and competitive equilibrium,"This is a paper using a competitive monopolistic framework (in GE). It is an old paper by Stratz (1989). Recent work with Stone-Geary preferences relates to the issue of structural transformation following the work of Herrendorf, Rogerson and Valentinyi (2013), although there is considerable debate on whether these preferences appropriately capture the data. All these papers have a representative consumer, with expenditure shares changing over time due to growth."
3433,Do banks make profits by selling bonds to the central bank?,"No, banks don't directly profit from selling bonds to the central bank. These bonds are sold at face value, there is no discount or premium, this is not part of the system."

3437,1929 stock market crash and unemployment rate,"One caveat to the author you refer to, Thomas Sowell is a staunchly conservative economist, so most arguments you hear from him will stick to the Econ 101 wisdom that government intervention is usually bad, tariffs are always bad (to be fair, it is hard to use them to correct externalities for global ""public goods""), etc."
3438,Is it valid to compare cryptocurrencies by using their smallest divisible unit?,"No, the above calculations are not a valid way to compare cost of these curencies, for exactly the reason you state:  a cryptocurrency is just worth what someone is willing to pay for it."

3440,Difference equation in OLG framework,The following approach seems to work in this case:
3441,Log of a Negative Market-Book Ratio in a Regression Model,Well the problem can be dodged by the use of some simple solution of just adding a constant to all values which circumvent issues of taking logarithms of negative numbers. Usually the mean is used as a centering point. If the mean is negative though some other number must be chosen.

3449,Help with this microeconomics exercise,"Given the production function
\begin{eqnarray*} F(L) = 10 \sqrt{L} - 2L \end{eqnarray*} 
marginal product is
\begin{eqnarray*} F'(L) = \frac{5}{ \sqrt{L}} - 2 \end{eqnarray*} 
Since there is no cost for the family for using its own labor and it cannot hire from outside, family will maximize its production subject to the constraint that it has 4 units of labor. 
\begin{eqnarray*} \max_{L\geq 0} && 10 \sqrt{L} - 2L \\ \text{s.t.} && L \leq 4 \end{eqnarray*} 
Given that $F'(L)$ is falling in $L$ and is positive at $L = 4$ $(F'(4) = 0.5)$, family will use all 4 units in optimum. The corresponding output is $10\sqrt{4} - 2(4) = 12$. "
3450,Dynamic Market Equilibrium: motivation for differential equations,As the link you provided mentions:
3451,Why does marginal private cost increase with quantity?,What doesn't make sense to me is that the supply curve is upward sloping because marginal costs increase. Why is it that it costs more to make the next toy than it did the last?
3452,Clarification about demand elasticity and monopoly,"You are correct in saying that there is an elastic portion within the inelastic demand. The concept is much easier explained when using a simple demand curve diagram. From the diagram given below, we can clearly see the varying elasticities in different parts of the curve. You can even try it yourself, using 2 points on each part and comparing the elasticity. "
3453,One bidder in 2nd price auction,The purpose of a 2nd price auction (Vickrey Auction) is to encourage bidders to bid their true maximum willing payment for a good rather than the lowest price they expect will win the auction. The reason for this is because they pay the value of the unknown second bid they don't have to worry about bidding to high because the highest bid will always pay the exact lowest they would have had to pay in order to obtain the product and don't have to worry about overbidding.
3454,"When estimating VAR(1) by OLS, I get transpose of AR matrix. Why?","I see that $n=2$ and $\mathbf \mu = \mathbb0$. 
At single (2-dimensional) observation level, we usually write (ignoring the disturbance vector)"
3455,Is the dictator game studied by game theory or by decision theory?,"I would say that the dictator game is of interest to a decision theorist more so than to a game theorist, although the dictator game can be formally modeled in a game theoretic framework. "
3456,Question regarding General Equilibrium under non-convexities,"You are right. Set of Pareto efficient allocations consist of all feasible allocations $((x_{11}, x_{21}), (x_{12}, x_{22}))$ satisfying the property that individual 1 consumes all of good 2 i.e. $x_{21} = 1$ and $x_{22} = 0$."
3457,How is it possible that shipping of eBay items from China to US is 'free'?,The major reasons that I understand are that:
3458,How to prove convexity + quasilinear preferences imply concave utility?,"Consider any $x_2'$ and $x_2''$ in $\mathbb{R}_+$. Without loss of generality, let $x_2'' > x_2'$. We can choose $x_1'=f(x_2'')-f(x_2') > 0$ so that $U(0,x_2'')=U(x_1',x_2')$. Let $\lambda(x_1',x_2')+(1-\lambda)(0,x_2'')$ be a convex combination of $(x_1',x_2')$, and $(0,x_2'')$. Since $\succsim$ is strictly convex and $U(0,x_2'')=U(x_1',x_2')$,
        \begin{eqnarray*} 
	&& U(\lambda(x_1',x_2')+(1-\lambda)(0,x_2''))  >  U(x_1',x_2') \\
	&\Rightarrow & U(\lambda x_1'+(1-\lambda)0,\lambda x_2'+(1-\lambda)x_2'')  >  \lambda U(x_1',x_2')+(1-\lambda)U(0,x_2'')\ldots(\because U(0,x_2'')=U(x_1',x_2')) \\
	&\Rightarrow &  \lambda x_1'+(1-\lambda)0 + f(\lambda x_2'+(1-\lambda)x_2'') >  \lambda (x_1'+f(x_2'))+(1-\lambda)(0 + f(x_2''))\\
	 &\Rightarrow &  \lambda x_1'+(1-\lambda)0 + f(\lambda x_2'+(1-\lambda)x_2'') >  \lambda x_1'+(1-\lambda)0 + \lambda f(x_2')+(1-\lambda)f(x_2'') \\
	 	 &\Rightarrow &  f(\lambda x_2'+(1-\lambda)x_2'') >   \lambda f(x_2')+(1-\lambda)f(x_2'')\end{eqnarray*}
Therefore, $f(\cdot)$ is strict concave."
3459,Disruptions in Server / Data Center Market,"Institutions like banks for many years now keep  back-up archives of their data in physical locations owned and operated by other legal entities. This is a standard case of outsourcing to specialists a requirement of a business process that is not a directly value-added activity. So the ""sole custodian of one's own data"" has been proven in the market not to be strong enough against cost-reduction considerations (or against price/value optimization if you wish).  "
3460,When action and strategy differ in game theory,"If you happen to know that the ""normal form"" is sometimes also referred to as the strategic form, you'd most likely not be surprised that it doesn't help you distinguish between the notions of action and strategy. The normal form is precisely used to represent strategies (not actions) in a game. To appreciate the difference between strategies and actions, it's probably best to consider another form of game representation: the extensive form."
3461,Does an increase in the money supply increase or decrease interest rates?,I will frame this in the context of modern monetary policy and for the sake of clarity assume we are discussing the American economy. 
3462,In what way specifically are US CEO's able to engage in rent-seeking and exploit corporate governance to increase compensation?,"Pre-Sarbanes-Oxley it was common for CEOs to nominate the members of the board of directors of their firms. A sub-committee of the board would determine the CEO's compensation, so a CEO could choose people loyal to him (even employees working under the CEO) for the board and those people could boost his compensation. And if they did not do so, he might also ensure that board members that failed to boost his pay did not serve renewed terms. In addition, they could potentially ensure that even when performance was poor that the compensation was high. Sarbanes-Oxley, along with changes from the major US stock exchanges, required independent nominating and compensation committees for boards of directors. It is generally seen in the literature that these rule changes curtailed this practice. However, some dispute that this was ever an economically important channel for self-dealing. "
3463,Can everyone in an economy profit?,"""If everyone can profit"" could be taken by if everyone has access to a chance to gain something from an investment. 
This investment can be of one's own labor (e.g. harvesting crops, transforming goods, or being employed) or of one's wealth (giving your capitals in exchange for interest)."

3466,Why is the short run average cost curve not a tangent to the long run average cost curve at the lowest point on the short run average cost curve?,The diagram is fine as an illustration of a possible relation between the long run average cost curve and one particular short run average cost curve.
3467,What determines the rate of interest on national debt for a country?,The first thing to recognise is that an interest rate is a price because the interest rate tells you how much the borrower has to pay in return for receiving a loan.
3468,Monetary expansion leads to decrease in inflation?,"In a nutshell, I think you're right."
3469,maximize untility AND minimize disutility,"I believe what you're getting at is a concept in economics called ""Loss Aversion"". It has been used quite extensively in recent economic research, especially in behavioral economics and finance. Another important key word here is ""Prospect Theory"", which encompasses loss aversion as well. "

3471,A general formulation to capture price stickiness,"I will answer the first question, I believe the second one can be found in the book's appendix."
3472,History of Macroeconomic Measurements before GDP,Maybe the earliest economic quantities to be measured are the number of people in a tribe or nation as a measure of economic and military potential. Roman (Roman king Servius Tullius) and ancient Israeli censuses (Prophet Moses duing the Egyptian Exodus) were said to have been conducted in the 6th and 13th centuries before the common era (Wikipedia -- Census). 
3473,Consumer demand: a function of present endowment?,"Although it's often left unstated, demand for a good is measured as quantity per unit of time.  Broadly, the longer the time period over which demand is measured, the smaller the (proportional) effect on demand of the initial endowment.  Whether you have a soda in your fridge one morning may make the difference between your demand for soda that day being $0$ or $1$. But over the next year, if you often consume sodas, it may make the difference between your demand being $n-1$ or $n$, only a very small proportional difference if $n$ is large.  For this reason, even at the individual level it can often be appropriate to ignore endowments as a determinant of demand for frequently consumed goods."
3474,Finding distributions of wealth from utility functions,"From what it looks like, you are literally trying to subtract $(2)$ from $(1)$, incorrectly as well (You didn't distribute the minus out correctly.) It is saying to use equations 1 through 2 to solve this problem."
3475,Block pricing for different products,"I am not exactly sure what you mean by ""block price"" and I don't know the bucket buddy. However, I feel like you are talking about what microeconomists term bundling, the practice of selling two (or more) different goods together in one package."

3479,theoretical macroeconomic topic for bachelor project?,"I would be careful about confusing topics and tools. Theoretical mathematics and data analysis are ways that you can approach a specific topic. No matter what topic you choose, you can apply your mathematical tools. I would recommend looking for something that interests you at a conceptual level and then seeing how you can apply your given set of tools to answer it."
3480,Is there any scientific proof that 2%-3% target inflation rate is ideal?,"Science doesn't work on the basis of ""proof"". Proof is something that belongs only in the realms of mathematics and philosophical logic. Whereas science works on the basis of the best-available explanation that fits the available evidence."

3486,What stops a government in partnership with its central bank from lowering interest rates and then borrowing at this lower rate to fund investments?,"What stops governments from partnering with their central banks to lower interest rates? Central banks in most countries are independent. It means that the governor of the central bank decides the monetary policy according to his/her mandate. This mandate is usually to keep a check on inflation and in some countries to lower unemployment rate. If the central bank lowers interest rates then due to the ""knock on"" effect you mentioned credit becomes available at lower rates which exerts inflationary pressure on the economy. If the mandate of the central bank is to keep inflation low then the central bank ensures that interest rates are not lower than what is required to keep inflation in check."

3488,Open/modern question in labor economics?,"If you want a recent state of the art in Labor Economics, you can have a look at the last Handbook of Labor Economics (2011, edited by Card and Ashenfelter). Though it is getting old, it provides an overview of specific approaches or questions in Labor. It is especially relevant if you want to define a research project for a PhD.  "
3489,Macroeconomics and equilibrium,"The world economy is a closed system as regards economic exchanges, but it is not a closed system as regards productive resources: earth as a natural system still has resources outside the human economic system that are continuously transformed by willful human activity and enter the economic system. Also, human time (enhanced with productive know-how) is something that continuously flows into the system as a productive resource."
3490,"In classical macroeconomics, why Labor supply responds to real wages and not money wages?","To begin with, economics is all about assumptions. Because of classical dichotomy, money level doesn't impact the growth of an economy in the long run. Money has no effect on GDP in classical macroeconomics. If you want to model the effect of money, you have to introduce nominal rigidities in your model. That means, at least the goods market or the labour market is NOT perfect. If labour responds to money wages, the result would be a prefect market situation."
3491,"Given $\mathbb Q$ and $X_t$ is $\mathbb Q$-Brownian, find $\frac{d\mathbb Q}{d\mathbb P}$ / Uniqueness of Brownian or Radon-Nikodym derivative","As you say (how did $\sin t$ in the initial problem become $\cos t$?), $\mathbb{Q}$ is a measure under which $W_t$ becomes $\tilde{W}_t - \sin t$, where $\tilde{W}_t$ is a $\mathbb{Q}$-Brownian motion. So Girsanov's theorem would say"

So far I have consulted primarily Springer's Use R series and free resources available on CRAN. I found the following particularly useful:"
3502,How can we measure the size of the new uber-driver-type economy?,"Those are important and difficult questions to answer. Regarding Uber, Jonathan Hall (Uber) and Alan Krueger (Princeton) wrote a joint paper on An Analysis of the Labor Market for Uber's Driver-Partners in the United States. The paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of Uber's driver-partners, based on both survey data and anonymized, aggregated administrative data. The following figure documents the exponential growth in the number of active Uber driver-partners in the United States from mid-2012, when uberX was launched, to late 2014."
3503,How to get hang of mathematical language that is so extensively used in economics?,"If you don't have any background in Real Analysis, I suggest you to read ""Analysis I"" written by Terence Tao. 
I was in a similar situation that you a year ago. I studied Economics at college but we never had to do rigorous proofs (as a matter of fact, I did not know what was a theorem, a mathematical proof, or mathematical logic until I read the book). We only learned some ""rules"" of derivation and integration, and to manipulate algebraic equations in order to get some important results in Economics. However, a professor suggested me to apply to a PhD program and to take a real analysis course. It was really hard because I had never seen something like that. The books recommended by the analysis professor were the common books you will be recommended here: Baby Rudin, Kolmogorov and Fomin, Ok, Abbot, Apostol, etc. I read some of them (specially Baby Rudin) and I found them too difficult.

Gross domestic product on Wikipedia (emphasis mine)"
3506,Producer's cost for buying full solution vs. buying parts,"Some economists (Oliver Hart and John Moore are among the most prominent) have developed a ""theory of the firm"" which could help address some of the issues involved. One of the considerations in that theory is that the different parties involved in production can 'hold-up' each other. For example, in this case, the brake manufacturer or the auto manufacturer can suddenly threaten to cancel the relationship with the other party, unless the contract is improved.  This, in turn, means they don;t invest much in each other and production is inefficient."

Marginal utility is just an economist's way of saying the benefit you got out of the last unit of something, and decreasing because we think this might be lower at higher levels of income. "

3521,How to calculate expected revenue in reverse auctions (procurement),"Hint: In second price sealed bid, it is optimal to bid your own valuation for the good. So in a reverse auction, it is optimal for each person to bid their lowest possible price they are willing to supply at. Intuitively, if one individual deviates from that strategy, it doesn't increase their chance of winning the auction or increase their chance at getting a higher priced contract, since the price they supply is based on other contractors' bids."
3522,Pay What You Want Pricing; Micro Foundations,"It seems that some consumers get utility from paying for the good.  This isn't always true, and it does seem counter-intuitive at times.  In fact, it often seems that consumers get utility from getting a ""great deal,"" and we often hear them brag about their amazing feats of 80% off. 
In this case, however, for a few different reasons, some consumers get utility for paying.  It is the responsibility of the seller to try to maximize or enhance the utility for paying in order to increase revenue.  They have a few tools to do this, including making a big deal about how some of their proceeds may go to charity and by thanking ""viewers like you"" who choose to pay more than $0 for the good in question, and whose contributions allow the producer to continue operating.  They may also provide Internet Points in much the same way that that Stack Exchange and other sites do in order to help incentivize suppliers to provide quality content in exchange for zero dollars."

Price-discrimination (PD) increases profits, because it incorporates different price-elasticities by having different prices. Therefore, a firm that incorporates PD should make, c.p. more profits than a firm that does not."

So the demand schedule is not affected, only supply. How? Since the tax is fixed per unit sold (and not a percentage charge), then the slope of the supply curve should not change. Therefore what remains is an upwards shift, that will lead to increased equilibrium price-decreased equilibrium quantity. The algebra should lead one to"

The first instance is on pages 9-12 where a geometric solution is provided. The choice set is not constrained to a discrete set in principle but the first part shows optimality when only the highest and lowest actions are chosen. On pages 35-36, Evans is proving that the geometric approach results in the correct solution, i.e. the discrete solution arises endogenously. Therefore, the remark is that you can consider a wider choice set and end up showing that the solution with discrete choices is also a solution when a larger choice set is considered."

3547,Is there a term for an externality in which prices for a good go up due to consumers being subsidized to purchase or consume that good?,"That's a standard case of a Consumer Price subsidy. Its effect will be that of market expansion: higher quantity at higher equilibrium price, irrespective of whether it will be lump-sum (a fixed monetary amount) or a fixed proportion of the price.  "
3548,What's the benefit the bank gets on offering me to pay my water/electricity/gas with credit card?,"By getting into a credit card contract, you effectively obtain a revolving credit limit, essentially a loan that once paid is again available (in contrast, under a debit card contract you only get the facilitation of ""plastic money/carry no cash"", but you are contractually obliged to fully pay the balance on the date due. Diner's Club, the first card, was and remained for decades, such a ""debit"" card)."

Then to see this claim, first notice by A2 that $(x,x) \succeq (x,y) \succeq (y,x)$. Then traveling along the $45^\circ$ from $(y,y)$ to $(x,x)$, A3 ensures the existence of our $z$. (Strict) Monotonicity assures uniqueness in the obvious way. Let $u: (x,y) \mapsto z$ where $z$ is defined in this way."
3551,Intermediate macroeconomics: optimal bundle for quasilinear utility?,From the utility function it seems L is leisure.
3552,Government bonds - the most simple example,"Using an example from the US treasury's website you can buy a \$100 dollar face value bond that pays 3% annual interest semiannually for thirty years. That means you would get $100 \cdot 3\% / 2 = 1.5$ dollars every six months, and at the end of the thirty years you also get \$100. In total you would get $1.5 \cdot 2 \cdot 30 + 100 = 190$ dollars but as it is explained in the link in Jamzy's comment adding up dollars in this case is not very sensible, because dollars in different years have different value.  (If you disagree I would love to trade with you. For 1000 dollars today I will happily give you 1000 dollars 10 years from now.)
 The price you pay for this bond is determined by auction. Using this you can calculate the yield of the bond. (Again, please see the explanation in the link.)
 The answer would follow the same logic for €100,000. You can convert the euros to dollars or find a suitable European bond."
3553,Equivalence of inada conditions and non-negativity constraints?,"In a standard growth model, people don't put non-negativity constraints as you have mentionned. Theoretically, concavity of the Hamiltonian (or Lagrangian in discrete time) is the sufficient condition for the optimality of the program.
Just for some additional details, the non-negativity constraints are so usefulin some subfields of economics, like in environmental economics. 
For example, if you want to put a ceiling for stock of pollution in atmosphere as $\overline{P}$. You can use it if you want that economy do not pass beyond this critical threshold. So, basically you can make as "

3555,Why are the 10 year German bunds and 10 year US treasury yield highly correlated?,"Because they are the so called ""Fly to Quality"". When markets turmoil investors look where to safely invest their money to avoid volatility and risk. This lead to a depreciation (because of the more demand in bonds, the less bond rate) in rates. After the QE, as you said, the left risk about the already solid Germany was cut out because of the unlimited coverage by the ECB on European Bonds. Germany and US are considered the two solid major economics of the World and every rational investor who wants to do not run too risk (because it is impossible to avoid it entirely, see ""idiosyncratic risk"" for further information) prefers to invest there. A similar but slightly different chapter is for gold, considered a ""Fly-to-Quality"" good as well. Concluding, part of the correlation is due to economic relationships that there are between US and EU and it also accentuates the effects of important macroeconomic news of one or the other party. "

While that term does indeed just equal zero, there could be generalizations where the agent works a high amount with probability $\tau$ and a low, but positive, amount with probability $1-\tau$. In this case, the term would still go through. There are also plenty of functional forms that would result in that term not being zero (taking away the -1, for example, which is often done in applied work). At any rate, this is an idiosyncratic enough case that the professor might have thought it best to show the process of rearranging terms for future reference and to give help with other scenarios. On the other hand, he may just not have noticed it. :)"

3559,Indirect Impacts Of The Netherlands Cutting Greenhouse Emissions?,"The Dutch energy system is small enough that the ripples to the global supply chain will be very small. However, it is looking possible that there might be some temporary tightness in the global PV module supply chain coming up, after years of capacity expanding faster than demand, so there might be a price-spike up, there, if the Dutch go for rapid PV deployment 2015-6. Conversely, there is a bit of a dip coming in the global offshore wind pipeline, so the Dutch might help there; they do have a deployment pipeline set out to 2023, so one approach would be to accelerate that to deliver all of those windfarms by 2020, smoothing the work of the global supply chain, and reducing wastage there. But the Dutch energy system is small, and so all of these consequences would be small at the global scale."
3560,How to derive cubic cost function from a problem of constrained optimization?,"A note on the parameter constraints:
$$TC(q)=a+bq+cq^{2}+dq^{3} = a + q(b+cq+dq^{2})$$
It appears that what we want is that for the second degree polynomial to not take negative values. This would require for it to not have real and positive roots. Since $c<0$, then if there are real roots one of them will be positive. This would imply that for an interval of positive values of $q$ the 2nd degree polynomial will take on negative values, and marginal cost will turn negative. So we need the discriminant to be negative, and so $c^2 - 4bd < 0 \implies c^2 < 4bd$. I don't see whey they write ""$3$"" instead of ""$4$"".  "
3561,Why are property price-to-rent ratios relatively low in the US?,"Reviewing their methodology, they make a number of assumptions that will affect their results.

3580,Find the optimal demand functions for capital and labour for this firm,"I think you may need some more information to find an expression for L (or K).
From what we have, we know MP1/MP2 = w/r, and that lets us say K = aL.
Now we look at our profit, the thing we want to maximize. Substituting K = aL into Q - TC, we get L(pb - 4w), where $b  = pa^{3/4}$, and p is the price.
As long as p > 4r/3, we can increase profit forever by increasing L, as long as we increase K proportionally. 
This assumes p is fixed, and labor and capital are infinitely available at r and w. So that's where our constraint has to come from. (Unless we're simply given a fixed value for Q, in which case we solve from K = aL.) 
If we have a demand curve, and we're the only supplier, we increase L and K until Q becomes such that p = 4r/3, or we hire people until we can't get aL units of capital, or we increase K until we can't get K/a units of labor. If we're not the only supplier, we play a game with the other suppliers and fix Q ourselves.
But I don't think we can maximize profit without that extra information, because the functional form of Q together with the fact that L and K are linearly related means Q is linearly related to L or K, and the cost function is as well."
3581,How does Perfect Elasticity imply infinite quantity for any higher price?,"""Calculus at infinity"" is a useful tool in Economics also, when we have managed to represent mathematically an economic situation. For example, when we model an intertemporal utility maximization problem with an ""infinite"" planning horizon, we only do it because it simplifies the mathematics considerably, while the approximation error is usually negligible for our purposes, since due to discounting, a finite-horizon setup would not produce any additional insight of value. We do not really argue that economic agents have ""infinite"" planning horizon.  "

It would be far better for that person to simply rent, rather than throwing away a few percent of their home's value every year in closing costs."

It will not be correct for the first player to think that if she instead chooses $y$, the second player will necessarily still play $a$. Remember this is a sequential game, so after seeing that she chooses $y$ instead of $x$ player 2 can also deviate to some other action,  say $b$. Therefore, by specifying the actions that each player will take in each node (even in the ones that are not supposed to be reached according to the strategy) we completely specify the strategy of each player, and can correctly check that no player has profitable deviations."

In fact in case of individual companies you can see that many companies fail and their stock price gets wiped out despite the stock market always growing over time so those are fundamentally different questions but I will try to respond to both of them.
3610,Do large- and mid-caps try to shun low share prices?,"I have no expertise in this area whatsoever, but I've taken a quick look and see a significant body of research on reverse stock splits. Although there are many reasons that reverse stock splits occur, overall findings on the hypothesis of an optimal share price are inconclusive. "
3611,Areas of Europe with more women than men have higher GDP and lower unemployment. Why might this be? [closed],"I believe this is generally true in the US, and I'll offer at a few reasons that are sometimes suggested here."
3612,Why does the US government not invest in the stock market?,"The US government could do that but policies prohibit this, since buying a specific company's stock benefits the shareholders of that company.
This would be a huge conflict of interest."
3613,What are the advantage of chain-linked prices over constant prices?,The advantage of chain linking is that component weightings drift away from their weight in nominal GDP as the reference period recedes.
3614,Find value of $\beta$ for which there is a strictly dominant strategy,"Let $h_i^*(h_{-i}$) be firm $i$'s best response to the other $N-1$ firms' strategy profile $h_{-i}$. If $h_i^*(\cdot)$ is a dominant strategy, then it must be independent of the other firms' strategies, i.e. $h_i^*(h_{-i})=h_i^*$ for all $h_{-i}$."
3615,Does the UK have a trade agreement with Australia?,"No, the UK does not have a trade agreement with Australia."
3616,What happens to interest rates when they are already at (near) zero and the stock market crashes?,"They would be just pushed to their lowest possible level. Recent experience in Switzerland and Germany shows the interest rate can be slightly negative but that’s it. Once the interest rate hit (zero) lower bound it can’t be pushed further as long as there is cash that carries implied zero interest. At that point central bank would have to resort to other policy instruments such as QE, helicopter money, forward guidance etc."
3617,How to calculate CRRA bounds from Holt and Laury (2002) type lottery?,"Let me rewrite your Option B as follows: £10 with probability $p$ and £1 with probability $1-p$ where $p\in[0,1]$ varies across the items in the list of options. "
3618,Notation? Inverse of demand function,"As a result we have $$ z\{p(t)\}\beta(t) = F\{K(t),L(t)\}. $$ Solving
  for the output price we obtain $$ p(t) = p[F\{K(t), L(t)\}/\beta(t)]$$"
3619,What determines rent prices of houses? Does it depend only on interest rates?,"What you're referring to is called the ""rental yield"", i.e. income generated from rentals as a portion of the amount you have invested in the house."
3620,Johansen test explanation,"I think that the wikipedia steps are not completely correct. When you perform Johansen cointegration test you first have to pretest the data to find if they have the same order of integration. That is all variables have to be either $I(1)$ or $I(2)$ etc. (see Verbeek, 2008). There are some cointegration tests and models that relax this assumption but Johansen is not one of them. But otherwise the steps 1-3 are correct. "

3623,Data for currency crises,I would begin my search by finding related papers in the Journal of Applied Econometrics that contains currency as a key word.
3624,Capital Recovery Factor for Hyperbolic Discounting,"I'll just expand upon what I've said in the comments as an answer. The sum $$\sum_{t=0}^n \frac{1}{1+rt}$$ will not have a nice closed form. However what wikipedia has done is approximate this sum as an integral. The integral will just be $$\int_{t=0}^n \frac{dt}{1+rt}=\frac1r\ln(1+rt)|_0^n=\frac1r \ln(1+nr)$$ Which is basically what you've got without multiplying by the principle value, and relabelling some variables. Now something to watch out for is that this will be off by a small constant. If you look at the diagram below, there is some error area that the integral fails to pick up, so it will actually be slightly smaller. 
 
In this case however you know the error area is below 1 (because if you imagine sliding each error area into the first square (purely horizontally it will not fill it all up)"
3625,Publishing in conferences and then journals,"In my experience peer reviewed proceedings are okay but if its a partner journal its not. I actually have fairly recent experience with this because one of my papers that I just submitted to a journal was published at one conference as a part of peer reviewed conference proceedings. Since, I am young scholar myself I also first consulted this with both my mentor and I actually even send an email to my target journal asking if submitting paper to that conference counts as prior publication that would disqualify it from publishing there and they said its okay they dont count that as prior publication. However, it would not be okay if the publication would be in actual journal (if the conference has a partnership with one) - the website you linked mentions this. "
3626,Meaning of UK Employment Change Index - 3 Months Average,"Let's say the raw series is $x_1, x_2, \ldots$. The three-month moving average is given by $y_n = \frac 1 3 \cdot (x_{n-2}+x_{n-1}+x_n)$. What you have, though is $z_n = y_n - y_{n-1} = \frac 1 3 \cdot(x_n - x_{n-3})$."
3627,Difference between unemployment rate between ILO and bureau of labor statistics,"With regards to the concept of 'unemployment' and the 'unemployment rate' it is important to note that, while the general definition (number of unemployed /number labor force * 100) is pretty standard, the exact parameters or ""operational criteria"", in ILO-speak, for how some of these concepts are defined can vary from place to place, often with large impacts on the final statistic.  "
3628,Which market category does this sustainable product belong to?,"I'm from Canada and I work on policies supporting ""clean technology"" development, but its a very nascent sector from a statistical standpoint.  Statistics Canada only recently formalized a (very imperfect) definition, and our federal export development branch politely puts your problem this way: ""For most Canadian cleantech exporters, the ASEAN markets are remote and not well known. Companies who feel that these countries may provide export opportunities should consult with Export Development Canada and the Canadian Trade Commissioner Service."""
3629,Does it matter which is the dependent variable in regression of time series data?,"Asymptotically, you should be able to interchange the role of $Y_t$ and $X_t$ and estimate lets say $$X_t =\alpha^* + \beta^* Y_t+u^*_t$$ where $\alpha^* = -\alpha/\beta$ and $\beta^*= 1/\beta$ and still get cointegrated relationship."
3630,Congruence of GDP as calculated by production and by consumption,"The GDP expenditure approach is the sum of consumption, private investment, government spending, and the difference between exports and imports. I have not dug into the German Statistisches Bundesamt but unsold goods should be accounted for in the expenditure approach under ""change in private inventories"" or ""inventory investment"" (grouped with private investment)."
3631,Optimal Production Input in Relation to Cost Minimization Problem,I`d propose you to follow these steps:
3632,Regular annual pension,"Firstly, the formula you have used for FV is equivalent to that shown here. What it calculates, with your numbers, is the value after 7 years of investing 200,000 annually at a compound rate of 7% (as a rough confirmation, 1,851,960 is somewhat more than 7 x 200,000).  Instead, you need the value after 7 years (or 6 years if the man is already at the end of his 24th year) of a one-off investment of 200,000 (call that V)."
3633,Does creating more jobs actually help the economy as a whole?,"Generally, whenever people have more income, it doesn't only benefit those people with more income. Imagine you somehow received \$100 that fell from the sky (or through NASA job). Would you save the entire \$100 and never spend it? More likely, you would spend some fraction of it... let's say you spend \$60. This money you spend will go to a shopkeeper, who then keeps a fraction and spend some of that \$60 on something else, and so on. So this extra money benefits other people too, not just the person receiving the money."
3634,Can you set $C / P^{\eta}$ to be the numeraire in a NK model?,"I'm going to answer my own question. Consider multiplying all prices and income (i.e., the wage) by a common factor $\lambda>0$. The new ideal price index is just $P' = \lambda P$. The new wage is just $W' = \lambda W$. So real expenditure, $C' = W'/P' = W/P = C$, is invariant. The ""numeraire"" should now be $C' (P')^{\eta} = \lambda^{\eta}$, hence prices relative to the new ""numeraire"" should now be $p_j' = p_j \lambda^{1-\eta}$, not $\lambda p_j$. That's a contradiction---$CP^{\eta}$ is not a stable unit of account."
3635,Why does strictly Walrasian demand with quasi-concave utility function mean that the walrasian demand having only one single consumption bundle?,"For case 1, you can argue $z$ will be unique by contradiction:"
3636,"The Fed Lowered Interest Rates, Are they going to buy Bonds?",There have been no such announcements as far as I know. The press release from the Federal Reserve mentions the following implementation details:
3637,What is the difference between a power law exponent and the Pareto exponent?,"A random variable $X$ has a Pareto distribution with Pareto exponent
  $\theta$ if  $$\text{P}(X>x)=\begin{cases} 
 \left(\frac{x}{x_m}\right)^\theta \quad \text{ if } x\geq x_{min}\\  \
 \ 1 \quad \quad \quad  \text{ if } x<x_{min} \end{cases}$$"
3638,"Given a rational $\succsim$ over a finite set $X$, show that there exists $x \in X$ such that $x \succsim y, \forall y \in X$","You are almost there, but I think you are starting in the wrong place. I think the key is as follows: we want to prove the claim for set $X=\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}$. "
3639,Solow Model with a Capital Stock Externality,"There is no steady state in the Solow framework. The system is explosive because $a,b >0 \wedge a+b<1 \Rightarrow a+b + (1-a) > 1$. Thus $(zK_t)^{a+b} (L_tz)^{1-a} = z^{1+b}(K_t)^{a+b} (L_t)^{1-a}$. I.e. this production function has increasing returns to scale. Such capital stock externalities are discussed in the AK-Models."
3640,Bertrand Duopoly Equilibrium for Discrete Prices,"The problem formulation admits the following Normal Form representation. We can reject any strategy involving price greater than 2, as demand falls to zero and such strategies are strictly dominated by those for which prices are either 1 or 2."
3641,"Why does the price and wealth derivatives, weighted by the price and wealth, sum to 0?","As mentioned by Mas-Colell, Whinston and Green, the equality is true ""for all $p$ and $w$"". It is a consequence of the budget constraint, which is satisfied for any prices and income values:
$$
\Sigma_{k=1}^{L} p_k x_k (p,w) = w.
$$
As you mention, the equality 
$$ \Sigma_{k=1}^{L} \frac{\partial x_l (p,w)}{\partial p_k} p_k + \frac{\partial x_l (p,w)}{\partial w} w = 0 $$
arises when applying the Euler-theorem to the budget constrained demand functions. As demand functions are homogeneous of degree zero in $(p,w)$, they are left unchanged when prices and income are up- or downscaled by any number $\kappa>0$: 
$$
x_l (\kappa p,\kappa w) = x_l ( p, w) ,
$$
and this equality holds for any value of $p$ and $w$. This implies the former equality and also explains why it is not only true for the upscaled new prices and income $(p,w)=(\kappa p_0,\kappa w_0)$ but actually for any prices and income because both $\kappa$ and $(p_0,w_0)$ can be arbitrary."
3642,Can I treat pooled cross-section as panel data and do regression analysis?,"Yes, you can consider this as panel data, but the key is to understanding why, as this affects how you explain and interpret your panel regression. In treating each cohort as the same unit over time, you are assuming that each cohort has a constant, unobserved fixed effect. That is, people in a particular age category and gender tend to have an unobserved effect on the dependent variable that is different to other cohorts."
3643,Is it bad for the economy of a country if forreign firms buy companies?,It depends upon the circumstances and isn't necessarily bad.
3644,Abraham (1987) Simple Job Market Matching Model,"Note that function $p$ actually depends upon a single variable $u/v$ and I prefer avoiding the abuse of notation 
(source of confusion) and write $p(u/v) = P(u,v)$. This implies:"
3645,Why is the price of capital ‘r’ ? (From Cost function),"Firstly, in your example the value of $r$ (as used by economists in this context) would be $1.03$, not $0.03$. Economists call this the ""interest rate"", but you might prefer to think of it as the ""rate of return on capital""."
3646,Bayesian incentive compatibility for a general distribution,Your reformulation is certainly correct for independent values.
3647,Why does one have to ask for a quote to get a price for some things?,"I believe that prices are typically available for well-defined products that dont vary between customers (e.g. groceries, cars, etc.). Whereas some products are customer specific (more so on the business to business side) and depend on quantity and quality simultaneously. I think of the example of a landscaping job (a service) that would depend on how much time the job would take (labour inputs) as well as the type of machinery (capital inputs) that would be needed to get the job done. Another example would be buying paper for an office, the cost would depend on how much you are buying and what quality and every companies needs would be entirely different."
3648,Is measurement error in self-reported health a problem in this scenario…?,Check the correlation between health status variables and employment status. Start with simple pairwise correlations and then perform auxiliary regressions where you regress a health indicator on the employment status variables.  
3649,Dixit Stiglitz price index FOC?,"A good way to think about this is to think about the cases where there are a finite number of goods, indexed by $\omega \in \Omega$. In this case, the partial derivative is
$$
p(\omega) = \frac{\partial}{\partial c(\omega)} \sum_{\omega' \in \Omega} p(\omega') c(\omega').
$$
The case in which $\Omega$ is a continuum of goods follows as a sort of limiting extension. See that even this finite sum can be expressed as an integral, given the proper measure $\mu$:
$$
\sum_{\omega \in \Omega} p(\omega) c(\omega) = \int_{\Omega} p(\omega) c(\omega) \,\mu(\mathrm d \omega).
$$"
3650,How is real wage growth achieved?,"Why would companies want to ""cancel out"" the wage increase? Their goal is to make money, not to keep real wages constant."
3651,Remittance: Migrant workers sending money to their families,"There are actually more pros then cons for the ""home countries"" in my opinion, and I have official/credible sources to back this opinion up."
3652,How does a govt surplus increases investment?,"The increase in savings you described does happen, in the short-run. Remember, tho, investment and savings are flows. Accounting identities provide us truths about their ex-post behavior, not planned or desired savings. "
3653,Monotonicity of second price auctions with bidder-specific reserve prices,"Some thoughts. If this was a SPA without a reserve price, the monotonicity of the allocation rule is trivial. When the reserve price is uniform across bidders then the allocation rule is clearly weakly monotonic now; since for low bids, increasing them might not change the probability of allocation. The only thing that makes this problem different is that the reserve prices are bidder-specific. So one possibility is that you only need to show that the logic for the previous monotonicity is still valid in this setup. Probably while trying to show that the logic still goes through you will find out if there is some extra argument you will have to make in order to still have the monotonicity. "
3654,Confused about what is meant by adjusting for inflation,"Things change in price over time. For example, a movie ticket in 1955 might cost \$.50, and a movie ticket today costs about \$10, 2000% as expensive in 2019 as in 1955. (source)"
3655,Does it matter if there's simultaneous determination between two dependent variables?,"In your concrete example, I think 2SLS is something worth considering because the error term u (of $y$, i.e. of tax collection) is plausible in theory to be affected by presence of cartels in ways that make it more unreliable in reporting (e.g. via increased corruption). Of course you can/should test this endogeneity."
3656,Continuity of Prices for Constant Elasticity of Substitution Production Functions,I think so. I didn't work out the proof myself but found in Wikipedia another version of the CES production function that has the same shape as your cost production function by replacing $1-\sigma$ with $r$. Here is the link. The exponents in the parameters $\alpha_i$ should cause no further complication.
3657,Stackelberg with 3 firms,"Start with the second stage, this is just Cournot competition between firm 2 and firm 3. You can solve this for the Nash equilibrium by setting the first order condition for firm 2 and firm 3 and solving these two equations, taking $q_1$ as given. This will give you quantities $q_2$ and $q_3$ in terms of $q_1$ which you can then plug into the profit function of firm 1 and you can maximize (i.e. find which $q_1$ firm 1 should choose to make sure the Nash equilibrium in stage 2 will be the most favourable Nash equilibrium possible for firm 1). So, step by step:"
3658,What is the proper term for “contraction economics?”,"It doesn't look like there's an established term.

3663,How does one do a hypothesis test for elasticity?,"Do you agree with the way I have set up this hypothesis test? If the estimate were less than 1, I would have stated $\mathrm H_0: \beta_{\ln m} \geq 1$ against the alternative $\mathrm H_1: \beta_{\ln m} < 1$."
3664,Resources for mathematician trying to develop (macro)economic thinking?,"You might be interested in David Romer's Advanced Macroeconomics. It's a grad-level textbook that includes grad-level math, but the focus is off the math and on the intuition. It doesn't spend much time going over certain tools, like dynamic programming, so it gets a bit hand-wave-y at some points, but it sounds like this might be the right balance for you.  "
3665,Are unit root tests necessary or useful on small samples of time series data?,"Cochrane (1991) says that unit root tests have low power, so you need lots of data (at best) to distinguish among non-unit root alternatives:"
3666,Calculating marginal tax rates when near a cliff,"The marginal tax rate is supposed to reflect incentives for the individual. In order to derive a meaningful metric, the calculation should hence try to reflect the actual decision an individual is facing. An increase in \$1 pay is probably not something people are considering. If, however, someone earning \$10 per hour considers to increase his/her labor supply from 35 to 37 hours per week, you will end up with a pay increase of sth like \$1,000 per year. So I'm rather sympathetic to the \$1,000 step than to the $1 step.  "
3667,Finding an economic policy that worked in a developed country but failed in a developing one,"In his book The Elusive Quest for Growth: Economists' Adventures and Misadventures in the Tropics, William Easterly discusses the failed efforts of states to use education, family planning, and debt forgiveness as means to grow out of poverty.

3674,Can monetary union work without fiscal union?,Can monetary union work without fiscal union?
3675,What is the economic meaning of distribution parameter in a CES-production function?,"In this answer you can see that $\delta$ becomes the exponent in the Cobb-Douglas function as $\rho \to 0$, i.e. as the elasticity of substitution becomes unity.
The exponent in the Cobb-Douglas production function is the output elasticity of the input(s), but also, it is the ""output share"" of each factor, under competitive conditions. This is why the scholars that introduced the C.E.S. function named this parameter ""distribution parameter"".
So you can start thinking from there.  "
3676,Using the sample mean to test hypotheses,"My question is simple: when calculating p-values, why do we consider the distribution of the sample mean (i.e., why is the sample mean our 'test statistic')?

In their model, people differ only by ability, i.e. the highest earning person is the most productive one. As a consequence, any marginal tax rate on this person will be detrimental to production and hence to social welfare (in this model). Therefore, the optimal top marginal tax rate is zero! "

3691,Question about the “No Dictator” Criterion in Arrow's Impossibility Theorem,"Arrow's Theorem concerns a social preference function ---that is, a function that produces a group preference order for every possible profile of individual preferences.  The axioms ""Nondictatorship"", ""Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives"", etc. must then be satisfied by the function at every profile.  (To be more precise, an axiom like IIA involves a comparison between the behaviour of the function at two different profiles.  So it must be satisfied by the function for every pair of profiles.)   Your counterexample only shows me the outcome at two particular profiles;  it does not specify the function itself.  Until you specify a function, we can't know whether the axioms are satisfied.  Arrow's Theorem says that, when you try to extend your example to completely specify the outcome at every profile, sooner or later you will run into a situation where you must violate one of the axioms."
3692,The relationship between indirect utility and expenditure functions,"Even if $u^b$ is finite, it can never be achieved. This is what is meant by ""does not attain a maximum"". Rather, $u(x)$ approaches $u^b$ from below as $x \to \infty$. This is because $u$ is strictly increasing. If we had $u(x_*) = u^b$ for some $x_*$, then we would have $u(x_* + 1) > u^b$ and $u^b$ could not be a bound. This is why $U$ is written as the half-open interval $[u(0), u^b)$."
3693,How can Factor Income paid to abroad be negative?,"I suspect that you are looking at an economic description which contrasts factor incomes with current transfers.

3706,What are the advantages and disadvantages to a country's people when the national currency is the world's reserve currency? [duplicate],"I cannot believe no one answered this. Someone could have easily given a one phrase answer, its called Triffins Paradox."
3707,Mean vs. variance - which is dominant?,"It depends on both preferences and circumstances, the latter being especially important if there is some risk of a loss."
3708,Supply Deman Equilibrium,"In the standard competitive-market supply and demand model, the prediction is that, when an above-equilibrium price leads to surplus, prices will naturally fall. You're asking why suppliers don't just sell less at the same price instead, yes?"
3709,Ramsey growth model - per capita vs aggregate variables,"For per capita $c=C/L$, I guess it comes from "
3710,Can all the regressors be endogenous in a given model?,"In principle, there is nothing to exclude the case where all regressors are endogenous. "
3711,Is Debt Monetization Equivalent to transferring money from rich to poor?,"In the US, broad debt monetization would produce the following losers:  owners of cash, bonds or equivalent fixed income securities- notably, China, Japan, and the other foreign US creditors, and entitlement holders such as pensioners.  The winners would be:  anyone who owns a real asset on a leveraged basis, such as property owners who have a mortgage, corporations who have borrowed a lot versus their cash flows.  This isn't really rich->poor, it's lender-> borrower.   This seems like an attractive policy for the US, although there's a very strong argument that the US dollar will permanently lose its reputation as a store of value if it were ever implemented."
3712,How does this demand function satisfy the Weak axiom if it doesnt satisfy the necessary and sufficient conditions?,Your equivalence result is incorrect. The correct results are:
3713,Effects of tariffs on company,"In the case of Apple at least, the answer is yes: this article dated August 31 2019 talks about the impact of the latest round of tariffs on Apple products produced in China."
3714,Fixed Effects Variation,"It isn't enough to have a large number of observations. You need multiple observations of each $i$ and $j$ for multiple time periods and doing trade with multiple countries. If, for example, if countries $k$ and $l$ only trade with each other, it wouldn't be possible to distinguish between $k$, $l$, and $lk$. In additions, you need multiple observations because you want to identify a time subscript on $i$ and $j$. If you have many countries, many periods, and many trade relationships, and the data are not sparse then this may not matter much. "
3715,Relevance of government liabilities to GDP,"The government debt represents the total liabilities outstanding that the government must (at some point) repay to investors. Generally to do so, governments tax their populace, either now, or at some future point."
3716,"implied volatility, how to get parameters?","The implied volatility is defined as the volatility parameter that gives you the option price currently trading on the market. That is, you will observe market quotes for option prices or implied volatilities and you use the Black-Scholes formula to convert from one to the other. The implied volatility is not therefore something you computed based on stock price data, it's really a price determined by the market."
3717,2SLS with endogenous interaction terms,"Let $X$ be the original regressor matrix and $Z = [z \;\; zd]$ be the intstruments matrix, and consider the IV estimator"
3718,Continuation value versus utility in asset pricing,"I can't speak to Back's usage (I can't access the book through the link), though in general, I believe the ""utility function"" refers to the standard meaning of the term (the ultimate function that agent's are trying to maximize), while ""continuation value"" refers to the Bellman Equation solved for the next period."
3719,Does Household final consumption Expenditure include Consumption expenditure of Imported Goods,Yes.
3720,Stackelberg setup,"Let $\pi_1(q_1, q_2), \pi_2(q_1, q_2)$ denotes firm 1's profit and firm 2's profit respectively when firm 1 produces $q_1$ and firm 2 produces $q_2$."
3721,Understanding Gorman Polar Form,"After doing some reading on the topic, it appears we would estimate this equation as we would with any other demand estimation. "
3722,Proof of DCF model by mathematical induction,"I suspect your induction hypothesis should be an expression for $P_t$ not $P_{t+j}$ , and should be discounting $P_{t+j}$ not $s$ times but $j$ times i.e. "
3723,Why are many railroad rights-of-way held in easement rather than in fee simple?,Though these are only educated guesses (contract law is not my forte) I'd suppose that there might be a few reasons why this is:
3724,Repeated game with stage game has more than 1 NE,"Though a bit unconventional to assume an infinitely repeated game without discounting, the short answer to your question is: yes. Any sequence of stage game Nash Equilibria is supportable as a SPNE. See, for example slide 11 of this deck, or these notes from Levin, starting on page 6. This is more directly addressed by the definition of SPNEs, found on page 137, Definition 132 of these notes. Or where those Columbia notes suggest on page 142: ""For example if there are multiple Nash equilibria in any of the final subgames then there are multiple sub game perfect Nash equilibria in the game itself"""
3725,Summary data on venture capital,"The best resource I've found so far is Pitchbook's quarterly summary. It includes some degree of historical data, historical data by funding stage, and historical data by sector."
3726,How is “opportunity cost” an useful concept? Even when it does exist?,"Probably the most useful aspect of the concept of ""opportunity cost"" is to distinguish between choice problems where a particular choice is available, but the alternatives differ.  The concept of opportunity cost stresses that when we make a choice of some action, we forego alternatives, and so the gain from that action is the difference between the benefit of that action, and the benefit of the next-most-preferred alternative."
3727,"Software for field work: collecting survey data (multi-platform, on-line and off-line)","I've worked in 2015 on a survey collecting ~300 answers from 130 different countries. We had similar requirements to what you described, with multilanguage functionality on top. it was not a RCT (Randomized Controlled Trial), we were surveying on conditions of work. "
3728,Macroeconomics: effect of technology/workforce in the short run,"For question 1, I think that investment has a demand-side effect on the economy. I think it isn't a supply-side effect because it isn't stated that the investors are responding to a supply-side shock. So I'm saying that AD shifts right. With shifts in the curves, there will be a change in equilibrium. For example, the process you described of both curves shifting right will lead to higher output (even though the price level might not change)."
3729,Cournot equilibrium question,To answer your question I will assume that 
3730,Is profit margin the same as net profit margin?,"Profit margin is profit after the cost of sales. If you review an income statement, you will see revenue, and then typically a data field called “cost of selling goods”. Revenue - Cost of sales is profit margin. "
3731,On the interpretation of the coefficients in a log-log model as an average,"The short answer is no, this is not so when the dependent variable is in log, unless you define the $\%\Delta$ as (100 times) log-difference. The reason is that $E(\log y) \ne \log E(y)$."
3732,Market Value Changing in Response to News,There are likely two major (and closely related) reasons for this:
3733,Why can't we control for squares and quadratics of predicted values in regression?,"For prediction, yes you can consider the models
$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \cdots + \beta_p x_p + \gamma_2 \hat{y}^2 + \cdots + \gamma_m \hat{y}^m + error,
$$
where $\hat{y}$ represents the first-step OLS fitted values and $m$ is chosen by something like cross validation."
3734,Mathemtical Economics Question regarding Profit Maximization,"Well, it's very straightforward question. You have a cost function, from which you can get a Supply Curve, by taking its first derivative. You'll find competitive price and quantity when the supply curve you got meets the demand curve. "
3735,What properties does a stable economy possess?,I’ll cover two of the possible policies that can be stable: interest rates and fiscal policy.
3736,Kuhn-Tucker and optimization (continue),"I tried this for a=0.5, T=10, w=2 and I get the following real solutions for t12 and t21:
(1) $t_{12}=t_{21}=2.8165$
(2) $t_{12}=t_{21}=1.1835$"
3737,How does market work when there are few buyers and few sellers at the same market?,"Hendricks and McAfee (2007) offer a theory of bilateral oligopoly. They consider the example of the wholesale gasoline market on the west coast of the United States, which is composed of a small number of large sellers and large buyers who compete against each other in the downstream retail market. They are specifically interested in the effect of a merger of vertically integrated firms on the whole sale and retail markets. They discuss price and cost formation. They also offer a review of the literature."
3738,What impact would falling oil prices have on the natural rate of unemployment?,We need to distinguish between theory and the real world.
3739,Can't government experiment on price in the case of a monopoly?,"If I understand your question correctly, you are proposing that the government sets prices and observes the behavior of market actors to elicit the demand and supply functions."
3740,Understanding the HP Filter,"The function $\tau$ is the 'line of best fit', the growth trend. The 'residual' $y-\tau$ is the output gap. So, $\tau$ detrends $y$ over time, to give the detrended business cycle $y-\tau$. $\quad y-\tau$ fluctuates around 0—it is positive when the output gap is positive and the economy is in a boom, and negative when the economy is in recession."
3741,Can number of children in rich country is small due to this simple economic factor?,Let me fist answer that individual decisions on whether to try to have children or not is a decision that is not driven by economics alone. There are many other factors that influence these decisions such as individual experiences and preferences and social norms.
3742,Proving consistency of quantile regression estimators,"I can give you literature. An authoritative book on the subject is Koenker, R. (2005). Quantile regression. Cambridge university press.. In there we read (p.126)"
3743,Dimensional analysis for the qdf/quantile function corresponding to the pdf/CDF for the size distribution of income,"Your random variable is $X$ = ""Yearly Income per capita measured in dollars"". So $X$ is a real-valued function. Its domain is usually left unspecified, while its range is measured in ""dollars per person-year"", as the OP writes it."
3744,Choosing Data for CES Production Function,The Penn Wolrd Tables have the data you need.
3745,Marginal Effects Interpretation,The paper computes the value of your coefficient $\gamma$ on its own with comparison to $\alpha +\gamma$1.
3746,Why are simple returns additive over securities?,"We have a portfolio of two assets, with prices $P_1(0), P_2(0)$ at $t=1$. In the next period, their prices are $P_1(1), P_2(1)$. "
3747,How can I motivate a dynamic model using utility and consumer preference where only one good is affected by past consumption?,I just wanted to clarify on Starfall's comment a bit. $\phi$ can be a bit confusing.
3748,GDP data for the baltic states from 1988-1994,The Penn World Tables for those countries goes back to 1990. Some of their indicators may even go back further but I haven't checked.
3749,How can lending be feasible on blockchain?,"So, I don't understand how loans would be feasible on blockchain."
3750,Block pricing vs Perfect price discrimination,"In a nutshell, it is because people talk."
3751,CES production function application problem,"Your y2 needs to be the output associated produced with those inputs. Given that you have a CES production function and you use World Bank Country data as inputs, you need output of the countries in that specific year. Typically we use GDP as a measure of output at country level. You can get it a.o. from the World Bank."
3752,Speculation: Why is it referenced and how do we account for it?,"It is problematic to use as a word.  Some of the better authors in the last one hundred years have defined it, but there is no consistent definition.  I provide an operational definition for a narrow purpose in a paper as those possessing risk-loving preferences.  That definition, of course, would exclude many traders.  I use it with reference to implications for prudential regulation, but I didn't need to measure it for what I was doing as their presence or absence didn't impact the empirical component."
3753,Can saddle path not go through the origin in Ramsey model?,"I guess you already went trough the algebra below, but just for context, the problem you're trying to solve is "
3754,Hotelling rule and the shadow prices in a peg,"I can give you an answer for parts (1) and (2). As for (3), I can't give an answer unless you show some work as per our site policy on homework questions."
3755,Difference between capital and current account,"You can think of the capital account as ""exports of liabilities"" - a capital account surplus means that a country is exporting liabilities (borrowing) from abroad to pay for imports of goods and services and/or for income transfers abroad (a current account deficit). An increase in foreign assets owned by the US is an import of liabilities: the US is buying liabilities from rest of the world by sending them goods and services (or reinvesting the returns from the assets they already own). The increase in foreign asset holdings corresponds to a current account surplus (as it must), but they are not the same thing. "
3756,Volume of trade covered by regional trade agreements,"What you're looking for is called ""utilization rate"" and I believe a government agency in most countries should have this information. Here's one example: https://english.bdi.eu/article/news/the-preference-utilization-rate-of-eu-free-trade-agreements/"
3757,Was there a Role of Technology in Macroeconomic Models before Solow?,The Solow model was indeed the first model to account for technological progress.
3758,Does multicolinearity of variables imply complementary inputs?,"A Leontief production does imply perfect multicollinearity between the inputs, since there is no substitutability between them. Thus, if a firm's production technology features non-substitutability between inputs, one would observe the firm choosing inputs in fixed proportions. "
3759,Testing the long run phillips curve / Contradicting empirical results?,"You are assuming the PC has not shifted over the period. For example, you can see at the top right some sort of PC. To see this better, you need first to analyse the data in evidence for regime shifts. The first suggestion is to connect the points over time. US example below:"
3760,Implications of differentiable demand function on the utility function properties,"In the (quantity, income) space, not being everywhere differentiable would mean that we would observe gaps, discontinuous jumps, or kinks, in the corresponding graph of the Marshallian individual demand function."
3761,Understanding minimums in the calculation of Human Development Index,"This means that if a country would have most of its population living out of subsistence farming, which in practice could be registered as zero income, this would lead to an estimated/assumed GNIpc equivalent to \$100 per year per capita, which no country would ever go below. 
Having this value makes sense when reading the starting notes of that section:"
3762,How effective is progressive tax at regulating monopoly?,"Progressive income taxes on individuals is not very likely to have any real impact on market power, but progressive income taxes on corporations can certainly have this effect. The key idea is that in many industries (for example, the financial industry), there are geniune economies of scale: having a big balance sheet allows an investment bank to take advantage of various synergies, meet demand from customers at lower costs and therefore at lower prices. This means that there is a natural pressure towards concentration in the financial industry. High levels of concentration, however, allow firms to price out their competitors from the market due to their size and the aforementioned scale effects, and can lead to a scenario of oligopoly."
3763,Conditional independence and no correlation,"[2] does not imply [1]. [2] and $E(u)=0$ imply $cov(u,x)=0$, which is about linear independence. [1] is stronger, as it refers to any type of dependence. "
3764,Consumer utility optimization question,I'll offer a little guidance to get you moving on the problem your own.
3765,GDP projections for the fifty American states,"Official forecasts seem not to be available. The Bureau of Economic Analysis did produce these forecast in the past, but not anymore."
3766,Price discriminating monopolist question,"MC = 2Q1 + 2Q2 for both demand functions. Set MR1 = 2Q1 + 2Q2, and MR2 = 2Q1 + 2Q1 and then you have a system of 2 unknowns and 2 equations. The solution ends up being Q1 = 15, P1 = 72.5, Q2 = 17.5, P2 = 82.5. In this case Profits under PD > Profits Under single price. See you in 468 tomorrow. "
3767,Why obligation acceleration triggers Credit-Default Swaps (CDS)?,There is an example of its use at definedterm.com from a Cemex 2006 Note saying 
3768,CRRA utility function with a scale parameter,"As it is well-known, preferences (even under risk) are invariant to affine transformations of the utility function. Therefore, adding a 'scale' parameter adds nothing in terms of fundamental preferences (i.e. in terms of comparing streams of consumption). I cannot even imagine what kind of 'numerical results' would be sensitive to it. "
3769,Is Soros' theory of reflexivity aligned with normative vs positive economy dichotomy?,"I would say there is some degree of correspondence between the two dichotomies. However, in the economic side of things, there is in my opinion a much clearer relation between positive and normative economics (at least in the theoretical side), as it is through the use of positive economics that normative means are supposed to be achieved. "
3770,Different terminology for discrete vs. continuous “marginal” concepts?,I found an answer that satisfies me in Preston McAffee's Introduction to Economic Analysis (2006):
3771,Clarifying the meaning of market capitalization,"The ""shares outstanding"" variable used in the calculation of market capitalisation is defined as all shares that exist (and not was issued in public offerings). The market capitalisation is the share price times the outstanding. Therefore, the numbers in question do not apply."
3772,Norway inflation and exchange rates,"I do not know Norway's economy. BTW, based on what you report, I would first rearrange your points into a more chrono-econo-logical order. Briefly,"
3773,College enrollment probability model,Model (1) is a regular linear probability model. Your results say that $x_1$ is significantly correlated with $y$.
3774,What economic factors should be considered in attracting suitable staff and determining pay for temporary project work?,"Characteristics of a ""project"", as per the Project Management Institute, are that it is temporary and unique (ie. non-routine)."
3775,What conditions characterise “cheap-talk” games,"Your general question is in my opinion far more interesting than the course problem, so I will answer that."
3776,Basic question on trade based on comparative advantage,You did not factor in the 4 Darwinian goals of global trade:
3777,Is comparative advantage only beneficial with convex utility functions?,"What traditionally matters is a quasiconcave utility function (that is, the individual/country at least weakly prefers mixing such that all better sets are convex). I assume that's what you're referring to when you describe the Cobb-Douglass example."
3778,Effects on transit system shutdown based on local workforce end-of-day times?,"That's a fascinating idea, and I'd thoroughly suggest additional research into the matter (especially because you might be able to conduct a quasi-experimental analysis using instances of changing public transportation schedules on labor market factors, such as Boston's temporary decision to keep the MBTA rapid transit open later)."
3779,Interest/Rental Rate is today's or tomorrow's MPK?,"I found the problem, and now I feel dumb but I suppose I should leave the question up so people can know the potential pitfall and prepare for it better than I did."
3780,How is population growth predicted?,"It's possible that the stories about drastic drops in Japan refer to working-age population, not the population itself. "
3781,What does non degeneracy mean for a preference?,"It means what Herr K. has guessed: there are acts $f$ and $g$ that the decision maker does not deem equivalent from the preference standpoint. In other words, the DM expresses a strong preference in at least one comparison he makes. a preference that does not satisfy it is a AA subjective expected utility with a constant index $u$ (i.e. such that the representation is $\int u dp$ for an arbitrary belief $p$). On the other hand if at least for one comparison the DM says $f$ is strictly better than $g$ then you satisfy it. "
3782,An explanation of the formula for the present value of an annuity,Take your second statement: $\dfrac{x}{r}$ is the present value of a perpetuity paying $x$ starting from now (first payment in year $1$)
3783,How does inflation work in real life?,"When the government prints more money, then how does this extra money end up in the hands of the people, they still are being paid the same amount of salary annually by their employers. "
3784,Free data on bankruptcies,There is a private database: http://www.bankruptcydata.com/ which appears to have all bankruptcy filings logged. It has a subscription but appears to offer a free trial. To access public court filings in general which would include bankruptcy filings you'll ned access to PACER which is the government's database for all public court filings although it does require an account and charges a fee for each document (https://www.pacer.gov/). In general public bankruptcy filings are likely not going to be offered for free publicly given that it appears there is no official government body which gathers this information.
3785,Why can't we use $R^2$ for different dependent variables?,"$R^2$ measures the fit of the model to the data.  Notice the ordering of that sentence, ""model to the data,"" and not ""the data to the model.""  You want to use $R^2$ as a criterion to select among two possible equations.  The fact that you are posting here also probably means either someone told you that you cannot do that or you read online that this will not work.  The fact is, it can work, but it does not function well."
3786,PPP / currency evaluation,"Your conclusion is correct here. Since at the current FX rate you can buy the burger cheaply at an equivalent rate of 2 EUR in the US. So basically, if you live in Germany and want to buy a Big Mac, you are better of buying the Big Mac from the US since via the FX rate you will still have 1 EUR left(if you started with 3 EUR) and hence this will increase the demand of the USD in the foreign exchange market and hence"
3787,Purchase of the public debts by the ECB,(The question about perpetual debt was covered by the link to the description of a perpetuity.)
3788,Phase Diagram - growth model,"In control systems engineering, there was the ""Aizerman Conjecture"" (the transliteration of Aizerman varies) that argued that a linear time-varying system was stable if the parameters (state matrices) at all times corresponded to stable systems. However, counter-examples were found to this conjecture."
3789,Wouldn't reducing Fed Balance Sheet lead to Inverted Yield Curve?,"As a preface to my answers, I want to point out that bond yields are set in the market. We can think of bond yields as being (roughly) the sum of the expected path of short rates over the life of the bond, plus a term premium."
3790,What are the 'best' variables out there to forecast accurately GDP and inflation according to macro literature?,"You likely want to do this in real time which means you want to do a nowcasting. This is tricky because many economic series are revised, which means you also need real time data (what were the figures when released rather than what is known with hindsight). "
3791,Stability of steady-state equilibrium for overlapping generation model,"In p. 334 of the book (2009 edition), I read:"
3792,what in real terms causes one nations currency to be more valuable than another?,"Exchange rates are prices.  Just like any other price, they change based on supply and demand.  Country A's currency appreciates relative to B if the citizens of country B want county A's currency.  Why does B want A's currency? Typically for the purpose of buying the goods, services, and investments produced by A."
3793,Making mathematical sense of the expression for realized bond return,"The approximation given is off at a key point - it is the duration of the bond at 9 years maturity, not the original duration."
3794,Relationship between interest rate and rental price of capital,"The equation is exactly the same,"
3795,Misleading vertical axis in foreign exchange graphs analyses?,"The convention in finance is that any currency pair ""currency1/currency2"" is to be interpreted as the number of units of currency2 needed to buy one unit of currency1, or alternatively, as the number of currency2 you get from selling one unit of currency1."
3796,Value representation theorem for countable set,"I use the usual notation $(\succeq,\succ,\sim)$ instead of $R$. I assume that $X_{\sim}$ in your question is the set of equivalence classes of $\sim$ on $X$."
3797,What is the A in the Accumulation and Amount functions for the value of investments?,Usually one can think of $a(t)$ as some form of interest. 
3798,"General equilibrium regarding on U= max(ax,ay) + min(x,y) [closed]","Let us name three consumers A, B and C, and two goods X and Y. Equilibrium price vector $(p_x, p_y=1)$ and allocation $((x_A, y_A), (x_B, y_B), (x_C, y_C))$ satisfy the following:"
3799,How to prove that GDP grows at the same rate as consumption on Lab Equipment Model?,"The household side of this model is pretty standard. Denote $K(t)$ be household's assets at time $t$. Then the transversality condition (which is an optimizing condition, not a constraint), is "
3800,"Question about skill-biased technical change, Acemoglu",I won't replicate the model -interested readers should read the link the OP provides. 
3801,When to prefer maximisation of surplus and when instead to prefer minimising differences in price and q to find market equilibrium?,Market Equilibrium occurs when the difference between demand and supply is minimized. Equilibrium price and quantity is determined by solving this problem.
3802,Additive multiattribute nonlinear utility functions,"These are sometimes known as ""quasi-separable utility functions"".  A recent paper that describes the theory is Quasi-Separable Utility by Qin and Rommeswinkel."
3803,The underlying force for creating specialized areas in the cities of developing economies,"This is an interesting observation that has produced a lot of theoretical and empirical research in industrial organization. In fact this phenomenon also occurs in developed economies, for example with gas stations. It is also not limited to location, the broader questions being why competitors in many markets tend to produce very similar products when they could also choose to differentiate themselves more strongly. A special case of the question is also often applied to politics, where the question is why different parties tend to be very similar to each other (most of the time)."
3804,Is there a systematic approach to find equilibria in sequential games?,You can first find all NE. Then you check which ones are subgame-perfect. Then you proceed and check for which of the NE you can find beliefs that are consistent with the definition of PBE. You can go on and refine the set of equilibria further by kicking out all equilibria that do not satisfy the additional requirements of your stricter equilibrium concept.
3805,Hayek influenced by?,"Hayek's The Constitution of Liberty is in my opinion the place to start. It has a lot of references to John Stuart Mill (which whom he strongly disagrees, btw), and puts forward his argument on freedom. There is also a very recent (but rather long) analysis of Hayek's book (available online here), which dissects his influences. "
3806,When was the supply and demand model first used?,The Wikipedia page about the supply and demand model has a History section. 
3807,Price setting firms with cost reduction technology,Your reasoning for the 1st part is correct.
3808,Where can I find real-time indicators of economic activity?,The projects developed by Alberto Cavallo and Roberto Rigobon could be a source of inspiation.
3809,Does the FDIC's insurance of your money in your bank account cause inflation of the bank were to go under?,"No, for three reasons. First, FDIC bailouts are funded via the guarantee fund, which is a pre-funded insurance fund that has never required an injection of cash. Second, if such an injection were to occur, it would happen through an appropriation from Congress, which would be implemented via a debt issuance from the Treasury— the Fed has zero authority to bail out the FDIC guarantee fund. Third, bank failures actually tend to involve a net contraction of the money supply, as distressed banks are less able to engage in new credit extension. "
3810,Federal Reserve Interest,"Not my field but I think this is a basic overview. If there are mistakes, please let me know and I can edit. "
3811,Value of the ruble in year 1825,"This website (in Russian) states that, in 1825,
you could sell 1 Imperial Ruble and get 0.72 US dollars. I don't know Russian so I cannot tell the source of that data. "
3812,Is there fundamental economical reasoning for patriotism?,I think the purpose of patriotism is to create incentives for actions with positive externalities. 
3813,What's the difference between gross fixed capital formation and gross private domestic investment?,The term gross private domestic investment (GPDI) seems to be used only by the US. The term gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) is used by the rest of the world (but not by the US). (This is thus simply the US being exceptional as usual by using its own terminology and methodology.)
3814,Implicit Differentiation & Profit Function,I will only set up the first part of your question. See if you can move on from there.
3815,"Why does the Federal Reserve seem to hold so much weight on the unemployment rate, relative to labor participation?","As mentioned in the press conference, other data is taken into consideration, such as the Employment - Population Ratio, especially when filtered/line series graphed to detail trends in demographics."
3816,General Equilibrium - Mas Colell Problem 17.D.2,Your answer is essentially the same as Mas-Colell's.
3817,Is Ireland setting itself up for a debt crisis?,Your figures seem to come from a European Central Bank analysis published in September 2016 for the position at the end of 2015
3818,Possible regression models for a dependent variable that is a proportion,"Let $y$ be the proportion in $[0,1]$ instead of the percentage. I think the issues here are possible nonlinearity and censoring. You can try including quadratic terms on the right hand side. At the same time, you can try the following models."

3820,"In fisher equation, Should I use “expected inflation” not “actual inflation”?","The Fisher equation as $$r=i-\pi$$ is little more than an approximation to the definition of the real interest rate $$r=\dfrac{1+i}{1+\pi} -1$$ where $r$ is the real interest rate, $i$ is the nominal interest rate and $\pi$ is inflation (the proportionate change in prices). You can complicate things by ""coninuous compounding"" but it makes little actual impact. "
3821,Symmetric mixed-strategy equilibrium: Entering markets [Solved],"I solved it, haha. Turns out I was being silly. I had completely neglected the fact that this was a 3-player game, and $\text{not entering}$ still had probability values attached to it. Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be the three firms. So the game looks like this:
$$
\text{P(A enter;B,C enter)+P(A enter;only B enter)+P(A enter;only C enter)+}\\
\text{P(A enter;neither enters) = P(A dne;B,C enter)+P(A dne;only B enter)+}\\
\text{P(A dne;only C enter)+P(A dne;neither enters)}

3822,Why is EV<CV if the good is inferior?,I believe Marshallian demands are less steep than Hicksian demands because we reverse the y and x axis in economics. Thus a larger derivative of x with respect to p will be less steep since p is on the vertical and x is on the horizontal.

3826,Comparative Statics on Balanced Growth Path,"The approach is not correct, because $\mu^{BGP}$ is a result of underlying structural parameters. So to say ""when $\mu^{BGP}$ increases..."" immediately begs the question why it increases, which underlying parameter(s) has changed to cause such an increase... assume it was $\epsilon$ that decreased. But in this case $g_k$ is not affected at all, so you see that you cannot claim what you claim about  $\mu^{BGP}$ affecting positively $g_k$."

3828,Does constant market cap imply reversion to the mean,"Identically:
$$ Market\_Cap \equiv Number\_of\_Shares \cdot Price\_per\_Share$$
If a market cap is constant than stock prices only fluctuate because of changes in the number of shares. Therefore, this would imply mean reversion in share prices only if the fluctuations in the number of shares were also mean reverting. "

But, since $x_i\ge0$, it follows that the admissible domain of $x_i$ is compact and the maximum is still achieved somewhere.

3850,Demand curve deriviation,"If I understand your question properly, it is correct that we do more ordinary statistical analyses such as linear regression to determine relationships between economic variables (e.g. price and demand.)  Utility is a tool which gives us a model of consumer behaviour based on very loose assumptions about how consumers behave (convexity of preferences, monotonicity, etc.)  While the demand curve can be derived from utility if we somehow knew the full preferences of all consumers, it can also be approximated from data by observing the real-world relationship between price and demand.  It is very difficult/impossible to measure utility in the real world, so using regular statistical techniques like linear regression to estimate the relationship is the logical thing to do."
3851,Do standard definitions of substitute goods and complementary goods assume the Law of Demand?,"A quick response is that if the law of demand is violated, then the standard definition for substitutes and complements may or may not apply."
3852,Is there anything like ratio between number of manufacturing industries to number of retail shops?,Economists are generally more interested in the aggregate output of different sectors of the economy rather than the number of firms or outlets.

Take $f(x_1,x_2)=x_1x_2$ (actually any supermodular function) and $g(z)=-z$ (decreasing and convex). Then, $g(f(x_1,x_2))=-x_1x_2$ which is neither increasing in its arguments or supermodular."
3857,Can anyone explain the connection between complete market and perfect risk sharing?,"Idiosyncratic shocks are those for which each individual face a different shock – while there is no uncertainty in the aggregate. Aggregate shocks are those which affect all individuals within an economy. When you have complete markets –– those on which there are securities for each possible combinations of the idiosyncratic shocks –– individuals will trade to insure optimal levels of consumption across all possible states. So, to get the value of risky options one only need to look on aggregate shocks –– as ultimately these are the ones which will determine prices."

3875,Is there autocorrelation in stock prices?,"Stock prices follow a random walk process, usually we include a drift term to account for the somewhat prolonged upward/downward drifts. This is basically an AR(p) process, p being the lag order. For instance AR(1) with drift is $X_t=\delta+\beta X_{t-1}+u_t$ where $\beta = 1$. Try testing this model for unit root using ADF test in stata. One lag is enough. You should fail to reject the unit root for an evidence of autocorrelation in the prices. Stock returns are not autocorrelated, they usually follow a stationary process if you take sufficiently long sample."

3880,Does a perfectly price discriminating natural monopoly cause externalities or any type of market failure?,"The question seems to be in between theoretical model and reality. In one type of theoretical model one may argue for the monopolist, in another against him. In reality it is worthwhile to mention that no monopoly can achieve first degree price discrimination. It is barely theoretically possible and not technically feasible. Other forms of price discrimination do not necessarily yield Pareto-optimal outcomes. Real world economists usually argue against monopolies in general, not against theoretical first degree price discriminating monopolies."
3881,statistical discrimination VS taste based discrimination,"You will find below two good and recent surveys on the literature on economics of discrimination and they all point out a clear difference between taste-based and statistical discrimination. We can imagine a situation where the employer's information about workers' productivity is perfect, such that there is no statistical discrimination, and still observe a racial wage discrimination for example because the employer has a taste for discrimination. Knowing the source of discrimination seems crucial to fight against discrimination and its consequences."
3882,Objective criteria and judgement of models,"This is a good question with a complex answer. Different models are created with different purposes in mind. As an example, there are qualitative and quantitative models. Qualitative models sacrifice some realism to demonstrate a particular phenomenon in the clearest way possible. Quantitative models sacrifice this clarity to create something more empirically relevant.

3886,Why do banks need to write-off the debt against Shareholders capital invested,"""Double-entry"" bookkeeping is the resulting methodology of the fundamental approach of Accounting science to what a productive mechanism does (be it a company or whatever): Accounting perceives productive entities as mechanisms to transform capital from one form to another, irrespective of what their economic goal is for doing this (profits, charity, whatever)."
3887,Making predictions with a distributed lag model,"So the short answer is yes, you can generate some predictions based on your model. Whether it will generate good predictions is another question. Basically you are only using the spatial variation to estimate your model and no time variation. So your predictions would most likely be very poor unless the relationship is very stable over time. There's also no way of knowing which lagged values of the explanatory variable would be useful in prediction, unless there is some spatial structure that you can use (i.e. some regions are leading indicators for other regions)"

3894,What exactly does “carriers of utility” mean?,"This expression is used for the arguments of the utility function, that is, for the objects the agent ""cares about"". In the canonical model, the only carrier of utility is wealth, but in behavioral economics a lot of things can be considered (beliefs, wealth compared to a reference point, ...)."
3895,Are Preference Relations Robust to Aggregation,I presume you mean to take the total (or average) willingness to pay for each alternative to be the social willingness to pay. $WTP_{soc}(a)=WTP_{1}(a)+WTP_{2}(a)+WTP_{3}(a)$ Then $WTP_{soc}$ is a representation of a social preference relation $a\succsim b \Leftrightarrow WTP_{soc}(a)\geq WTP_{soc}(b)$. This preference is transitive and complete. Individual and aggregate preferences are consistent in the sense that they satisfy the Pareto criterion and the independence axiom of Arrow's impossibility theorem. The way we have tricked the impossibility theorem is that we have taken an ordinal preference relation and turned it into a cardinal concept (WTP).
3896,Increase in the number of jobs in an economy: Central Bank raises interest rates?,"When people find jobs, they start receiving salaries and their consumption increases. Increased demand for goods and services leads to increase in prices, or inflation. Fed is expected to respond with a rate hike to keep inflation in check. "

3898,What's the relationship between IS-LM model and loanable funds model and what's the differences?,"The LM-curve is completely independent from the loanable funds market. This is because the loanable funds market is entirely determined by the real side of the economy. Therefore, it is linked to the IS curve, not the LM curve. Even more, equilibrium in the loanable funds market for given $Y$ allows you to derive the IS curve, just as the keynesian cross allows you to do."

3902,Two good sources (books preferably) that show the leading and most reasonable arguments for/against “trickle down economics”?,"This is a very large subject, where the terms have not even be well defined. I find it very unlikely that you will find an answer. Before even attempting to do so, you should define concisely what is meant by the terms. And particularly, are you talking about stabilization(short run) or structural(long run) economics? Because those two things are entirely different. One strategy is to study the classical and Keynesian schools of economics, since generally it at least to me appears that classical economics is called supply side economics, while keynsians are called demand siders."

3904,How is project value enhanced by uncertainty in market payoff?,"In general, if you own an option, holding fixed the expected value of the underlying asset and the strike price of the option, the greater the variance in the distribution of the prices of the option the (weakly) more valuable the option is. Here is a graphical example of a call option at maturity. They grey line indicates the value of the option for each value of the underlying asset where the strike price is \$5. The blue diamonds indicate the payoffs for values of the underlying at 4 and 6. If each are equally likely (p=0.5) then the underlying has an expected value of 5 and the option of \$0.5 (the lower green square). This distribution as a standard deviation of 0.5. Increase the standard deviation to 1.0 but hold the expected value constant at 5 by  changing the two underlying outcomes to \$3 and \$7 (orange squares). The expected value of this option is 1 (higher green square), so the increase in variance of the distribution of the underlying asset has increased the value of the option even though the expected value of the underlying is unchanged.

3906,How to relate real rate of return on capital to bond interest rate: Lagrangian,"Ignoring the expectations operator, your lagrangean has two mistakes: first the constraint is per-period so it is also multiplied by the discount factor. Second,  the way you have wrote the time indexes is inconsistent, as regards their interpretation for capital and bonds. If $K_t$ denotes ""capital at the beginning of period $t$"" (as it does), you should also write $B_{t}$ instead of $B_{t-1}$, to denote bonds held at the beginning of period $t$. This takes with it also the time index on $Q$. "

3931,How could monetary policy be affected if cash “gifts” to consumers were more frequently used?,"This is only inflationary if the monetary authority monetizes the borrowing. If the Treasury borrows $1000 on the open market by issuing a bond and sends the money to a consumer, no money has been created— it has simply been borrowed from one person and given to another. However, if the monetary authority purchases that bond (swapping base money for the bond), then it is indeed inflationary, as the amount of money now in circulation has increased. "

3933,Data Request: Raw housing stock of particular city,"There really isn't high-frequency data out there for free, but bi-annual data are available from the Census American Housing Survey. The survey goes back to 1973, though data at the metropolitan area level don't go back that far. Also, the data are extrapolated from a sample, so caveats apply."
3934,Beginner level books on market economics,"For introductory learning nearly any introductory economics textbook would do. For example, Mankiw's 7th edition has a section on ""How Markets Work"" and ""Saving, Investment, and the Financial System"". The latter discusses stock and bonds. "
3935,Estimation of the future growth of real GDP per capita of the world,"I don't think there is a consensus about this. In 1980s and 1990s, growth theorists have tried to endogeneize the technological progress in growth models, that shows a ""balanced growth path"" (in which economy grows at a constant rate in long distance.) So, we can say that economists don't want a decrease in GDP."
3936,Competition between utilities like ports,"In America, on the West coast, unions negotiate a common contract:"
3937,Hypothetical Long-term Business Cycle,"You are correct that there have in fact been periods of time when growth was flat, or even negative. For example, if one could observe the economy of the Cahokia over time, one would expect to see a period of negative growth. Further, the rapid growth we're to which we are accustomed is a very recent phenomenon. "
3938,Does the demand for bad quality products increase when there is information asymmetry?,"In the second case (information asymmetry) there is only a single market. This may be the market for the product with unknown quality or in case of adverse selection it may be a market for the bad quality product alone. Assuming there is no adverse selection the reservation price of a consumer w.r.t. the unknown good is the expected value of his reservation prices from the full information case. Thus it is a weighted average and will fall between the reservation prices of the good quality product and the bad quality product. Since this is true for all consumers, the demand function adjusts in the way you described."
3939,Budget constraint hyperplanes,"The set $\{\mathbb{p}:\exists \alpha \in (0,1), \mathbb{p}_1=\alpha b_i, \mathbb{p}_2=(1-\alpha)b_i\}$ coincides with the hyperplane $\{\mathbb{p}:p_1+p_2=b_i\}$, therefore you are not finding extra hyperplanes by doing this and varying $\alpha$."
3940,Shapley value with large number of players,"The sampling approach rigorously would look like this. For each player $i$, we want to estimate the expected marginal contribution, where the expectation is taken over a the subset of players that precede $i$ in the permutation ordering. So for each $i$, we do the following."
3941,ARCH Model - Expectation of Absolute Value,I don't believe $w>0$ is necessary or sufficient to get a positive standard deviation everywhere. I think you need $\sigma_0 \geq 0$ and $w\geq 0$ with one of the two inequalities strict.
3942,Weak axiom of revealed preference and choice coherence - how to show they are equivalent,"Yes, they are equivalent. Here is a formal proof by contradiction."
3943,Moral and economic development paradox?,"Yes, there is some evidence that immoral behavior, as exemplified though political corruption, is bad for economic development. The body of literature is large and to the extent that I am familiar with it, some corruption can ""grease the wheels"" and hasten development. In general, massive amounts of corruption is seen as a serious hinderence to development."
3944,Is there an equilibrium between privately owned and publicly listed companies?,"I don't know exactly how the numbers would work out, but you would expect an equilibrium but it will depend on many factors."
3945,Why can't price level be negatively correlated with money demand?,You're supposing the amount of money held for transactions by players is arbitrary. This may be true if you look at an individual - I typically withdraw fixed amounts of money when my purse starts feeling empty - but is not true on average and in the long run.
3946,Defining a Competitive Equilibrium for a two Period Model,A competitive equilibrium is specific to the economy you're modeling. Your economy has three markets:

3948,Sign of substitution and income effect of a price change,"The income effect is negative for normal goods and positive for inferior goods. That is, you buy more normal goods when you are richer and less inferior goods. "
3949,Does anyone know of any resources that discuss the differences between Hicksian and Marshallian remanding in depth and in an organized way?,"Technically they are related but are not the same Marshallian (or Walrasian henceforth) demand is the result of $x(p,w)\in argmax_{y\in\mathbb{R}^{L}_{+}}u(y)$ subject to $p'y(p,w)\leq w$. The Hicksian demand is the result of the dual problem $h(p,u)\in argmin_{y\in\mathbb{R}^{L}_{+}}p'y$ subject to $u(y)\geq u$. 
The formal relationship is established trough the value functions of both problems, for the walrasian demand we have the value function or indirect utility $v(p,w)=u(x(p,w))$ and the value function of the second problem (hicksian demand) is the expenditure function $e(p,u)=p'h(p,u)$. 
Now, the indirect utility and the expenditure are inverses of each other in the following sense:"

3951,The Cash Flow Sensitivity of Cash,"This is a standard regression equation, in the context of an econometric approach. The authors postulate a theoretical relationship between the variable ""Change in Cash Holdings"", which is treated as the ""dependent variable"", while ""Cash Flow"" and the rest are the explanatory variables/regressors.

the values of $c$ and $d$ do not impact the optimal bundles. I'll provide complete working on your other question (Marshallian Demand for Cobb-Douglas)."
3958,How does one graph indifference curves for a set of Lexicographic preferences?,"You can draw discontinuous functions in a standard $R^2$ space. For example when you draw a floor functions (a discontinuous function), the standard coordinates are still appropriate. Just make clear what to what part the discontinuous point belongs to.
Usually, for lex. preferences, one draws only the preferred set. Here you can find a graph of this kind (page 2)."
3959,Is it possible to calculate how long it will take to reach Break Even Point if the information provided is only an ROI (Return On Investment) of 10%?,Lets say your investment is $x$. What does ROI mean? The money you get per period out of your investment (= revenue). 
3960,The most frequent causes of economic downfall?,"Interestingly, Romer and Romer (2014) show that financial crises are typically not causing major downfalls in economic activity, if you restrict your sample onto the developed countries post WWII."
3961,What are the widescale economic ramifications of people holding onto their money instead of spending it?,"The amount that people save depend on the marginal propensity to consume (MPC), i.e., part of the additional income that a person consume, hence, $1-MPC = savingrate$. Keynes assumed that with increase in income MPC would increase, while neo-Keynesian assumed it to be constant in their analysis. But real data shows that MPC increases with elevation of income but decreases with large income gains. Hence, in a way, rich people save more relatively to others. But that is not the reason why they are rich, more saving is the effect, not the cause. Mostly, the reasons behind getting rich are the apt investment decisions."
3962,Fixed effects in treatment model,"This sounds like the standard ""drop one dummy"" requirement when binary characteristics are included in linear regression - because otherwise, we will get perfect mutlicollinearity and no-solution.  "
3963,From single-consumer-multi-units to multiple-consumers-single-unit,The cumulative distribution function (CDF) describes the probability that a random variable X with a given probability distribution will be found to have a value less than or equal to x. That is: $$F_X(x) = P(X \leq x) $$

3966,Lump sum taxation in the overlapping generations model,"If I understand correctly the set up, the government does not destroy real goods, it just collects fiat money and destroys it to reduce the available quantity of money (since money is in the hands of the individuals). The fact that the government calculates the amount of fiat money to collect by using a real-goods base, $\tau$, does not alter this fact. But then, all endowment is consumed and the government's actions just affect the price level."

3971,What exactly is Foreign Currency Indexation?,A currency can be indexed but so can a bond. An indexed bond is one where the coupons and principal are indexed to another currency (the U.S dollar in the case of Tesobonos) at the spot rate in effect at the time of issuance. So you actually pay in the local currency but how much you pay depends on the prevailing exchange rates when payment is due.

3973,Can I use percentage change in CPI to calculate fare rate schedule?,"Without anything better than a CPI, a CPI would approximate it. That said, I don't think it would be accurate. A better gauge would be a measure of the cost of living for the effected people. Vehicle maintenance and the like would be much higher than a typical person."
3974,What impact did major fiscal policy actions taken during the Great Recession (2007-09) have on U.S. economic performance?,"The fiscal policies to fight the great recession in the United States were not administered in a way that would allow us to assess this a natural experiment. However, there have been many situations in the past where there was such a natural-experiment setting, and that allows us to approximate the effect of these fiscal policies. For example, if a dollar of additional government spending, when such variation is experimental in nature creates two dollars in private consumption and investment (a multiplier of two), then when the government spends a trillion dollars in a way that may be endogenous, you could guess that the effect on private consumption would be something like two trillion. "
3975,When using consumables consider the purchase or market price?,"Assuming you plan to keep both oil and wood in stock, and they both give you the same quality of heating, presumably you should burn whichever will cost less for you to replace. That would be the fuel that will cost less to buy in the future when you buy it."

3977,Is Dollarization a good decision for a small open economy with an economic cycle that weakly correlates with the anchor country?,"Like many questions in economics, optimal behavior depends on the set of alternatives. The alternatives of Panama, El Salvador, and Ecuador to dollarization are likely a heavily politicized monetary and exchange rate policy. And so for the hypothetical small open economy considered in the question, the key issue is ""What's the institutional effectiveness and independence of the potential monetary authority?"""
3978,Am I using quantity and price correctly in trying to calculate price elasticity of supply?,"It does not really mater, as you will get the same numerical values eventually. You may choose whatever is more convenient in each particular situation. Convention is, however, to replase $q$ with $q(p)$ to derive a formula for elasticity as a function of the price only."

For simplicity, consider a deterministic dynamic programming problem (in OLG model, you'd have age as another state variable, but I'll abstract from that).

3987,What makes a factor valid in a factor pricing model of assets?,"This is a partial answer (see section 5.1, p. 79 of Cochrane's book, ""Asset Pricing""). Suppose you wanted to treat the size of the firm as a factor. Stocks of smaller firms typically have higher average returns. You could then form a ""large"" holding company comprised of smaller firms. The new, large company would then have returns like a smaller company but would in fact be large and ""the managers could enjoy the difference."""
3988,Estimation of point-identified Dynamic Discrete Choice models with moment inequalities,"Function $Q$ has to be minimized wrt $(\theta,\alpha)$.
The parameters $(\theta,\alpha)$ compatible with Nash equilibrium and rationalizing (or generating) the data have to satisfy $$g(x;\theta,\alpha)\leq0.$$ 
In the case where, for given $x$, $$g(x;\theta,\alpha)>0,$$ the parameter values have to be changed in order to possibly reverse the strict inequality and minimize $Q$. 
If $$g(x;\theta,\alpha)\leq0$$ for some $(\theta,\alpha)$, then this should not contribute to increase $Q$, because it is fully compatible with the data and model. Hence the term $\min\{g(x;\theta,\alpha),0\}$ in the expression of $Q$."

3998,Why will inflation raise sellers' purchasing power?,"Am not a trained economist, but I would think this may be a temporary effect. A merchant may sell his newly purchased items for $2. Scruples aside, he could sell his existing inventory of that item (purchased at the pre-inflation wholesale price) at the post-inflation retail price. Again, an opportunistic, but temporary, advantage."
3999,Are businesses and individuals buying clean / green / renewable energy contribute to slowing down the climate change?,"Your intuition is correct, actually switching from dirty good to clean good will also increase demand for clean good so price there might increase as well. However, this does not mean doing some voluntary change could not help as it also depends on how the quantity demanded changes with price (elasticity of demand). So switching is not necessarily unhelpful. "
4000,Why are indifference curves (often) of infinite length?,"If you are using the definition of indifference curve on wikipedia then they can be of finite or infinite length. For example if you are completely indifferent between the two goods, the indiffernce curve would be of the form $x+y=const$ which is of finite length (in the positive quadrant). "

4003,(Modified comparative advantage model)Can trade with a country that only has one industry be mutually beneficial?,"I did not encounter this kind of example before but I think comparative advantage would still apply. In Ricardian model opportunity cost can be expressed as a ratio of outputs $a$ for food $f$ and bronze mirrors $b$ as $a_f/a_b$. If Japan can create A units of food but 0 bronze mirrors the opportunity cost would be given by $A/0$ now this is undefined in mathematics, because limit of the expression would not give you the same value from both sides, but since we are working only with positive quantities (presumably output cant be negative) we could evaluate the limit only from positive side which will give you $\infty$ meaning that no matter how much you sacrifice food you will get no mirrors."

You would just lie and be random anyway so why would the other player ever believe any signal at all? That renders signals useless. Perhaps the people you overheard meant just that."

4008,Calculating the amount paid for a loan in today's dollars,"The monthly payment formula tries to ensure that you pay a constant amount each month. Hence, in real terms, you are actually paying more up front as $117.46 today is worth more than in 20 years assuming positive inflation. The more you pay up front, the less you have to pay in total. Even if you managed to correctly calculate payments such that they were constant in real terms, you would end up paying more in nominal terms than if payments were constant in nominal terms."

4012,CES v. Leontief Aggregator in Production,"I guess it depends on the application in question. Leontief function presumes that there is no substitution between the arguments, i.e. no amount of increase in one argument can compensate the decrease in another to keep output at some original level. In contrast, the general CES does allow some degree (as captured by the parameter $\gamma$) of substitution between the arguments. Note also that Leontief is obtained by taking $\gamma\to\infty$, thereby rendering the elasticity of substitution between the arguments $0$. "
4013,Do recessions matter?,"Whether it matters depends on what you are interested in. Some variables might be unaffected. However, many of the interesting ones are."
4014,The purpose of advertising for Pepsi,"Advertising is hard to understand if you take classroom economics models too literally.  I highly recommend diving into the literature on behavioural economics if you are truly interested. But for the purposes of your question, Pepsi runs advertising because it operates in a market in which consumer choice is primarily driven by two sources of cognitive bias: the anchoring and the availability heuristic.  "
4015,CES production function profit and supply function,"Hint: Solving for the FOC's assumes that the solution is interior, in this case, that profits are positive and smaller than $\infty$. I would recommend you to derive the cost function $c(y)$ and then study its derivative. If the marginal cost is always smaller than the price of the good (probably it is assumed to be 1) then producing more is always better and profits are unbounded. However, if the marginal cost is always larger than the price, then the optimal is to produce nothing and get zero profits. "

If you mean a graph wherein you show that Marginal Factor cost is not equal to the inverse input supply curve, then you do not need the graph at all. The fact that $MFC(x) \neq w_x$ shows that the buyer has market power."
4021,Insurance and Hirshleifer effect,"Here is what I thought could be a simple example. Suppose there are two periods ($t_0, t_1$) and two possible states of nature ($s_1,s_2 $) that arise in period $t_1$. Suppose there are two agents. The first agent has an income stream that pays off only in state $s_1$ while, second agent's income stream pays off only in state $s_2$. Consumption happens only in $t_1$ and both agents prefer to consume in both the states than in just one (Inada condition as consuption goes to 0 is not satisfied) and more is always better. If at $t_0$, neither agent knows the state at $t_1$ then they might enter into a trade that ensures them positive consumption across both the states."
4022,Need help reading early 20th century stock market list,"I am unfamiliar with this style of notation, but in my opinion it seems likely that the double fractions denote buy and sell prices. I.e. on Nov 29th 1911 the sell price was 104 3/8 and the buy price was 104 7/8. This gets you an average or mid price of 104 1/2 = 104.5."

4034,Why investing in bonds imply a decrease in money demand?,"There are a few sub-questions in this question, and I will not attempt to answer all of them. These “economics 101” models are extremely abstract, and it takes a lot of effort to relate them to observed economic behaviour. (I worked in fixed income research for 15 years, and cannot recall industry research ever referring to them.)"
4035,What will be the effect on velocity of money when demand for real money increases?,(a) The effect of this policy change sounds theoretically ambiguous to me. It ultimately depends on the consumers' preferences. 
4036,Tit-For-Stat Strategy Best Replies,"Instead of calling the three strategies you named the ""best possible replies"", I would say that they are the most salient replies. As you mentioned, there are many other potential responses to a tit-for-tat strategy. It turns out that what best responds to a tit-for-tat strategy is also a tit-for-tat strategy. Every other strategy will produce a lower payoff than using the tit-for-tat. "

is called an antagonistic game. Sounds like what you want is a symmetric antagonistic game?"
4038,What effect does a wage ratio cap have on the efficency of allocation of labour?,"The effects can be quite different from a price (wage) ceiling. The baseline case where you have homogeneous, inelastically supplied labor that's free to move across different ""types"" of work produces no supply response in reaction to a wage ceiling, but leads to complete specialization in one type of labor or another in the case of enforced bounds on relative wages which rule out the competitive market allocation."

With the ever-increasing demand for bandwidth, there is a need for capacity."
4040,Measuring quantities for price indices?,The notation $q_{i}(t_{0})$ does not necessarily mean number of goods sold in instant $t_0$. It can also mean the number of goods sold in the period denoted by $t_0$. As you point out the first one would be somewhat difficult to measure.
4041,How to interpret Employment Elasticity in this text?,I'm citing the first two lines of the article you refer to (emphasis mine):
4042,Should I construct balanced data with only necessary variables or unbalanced data with many potentially usable variables?,"The key question to ask here is this: is the data missing a random selection of the population/sample? If this is the case (a situation called Missing Completely At Random, MCAR, you can simply discard the observations with missing values and run your model on the balanced panel. Conversely, if that is not the case (Missing Not At Random, MNAR), an estimation from the balanced panel will be biased. There is also an intermediate case, Missing At Random (MAR), which depends on distinguishing between missing based on observables (in which case you can do simple imputation), or missing on unobservables, in which case you need to perform a two-step Heckman estimation. Read more about missing data here, and in this very approachable book."
4043,World Bank lending categories,As this page states:
4044,Political theories of inflation,"One book that may help you out is Macroeconomics and the Phillips Curve Myth by James Forder.  His narrative is similar to the one you refer to, but the terminology is a little different.  He argues that pre-1968 that the economic literature had a more nuanced understanding of inflation that incorporated factors like profit and union power to a greater extent.  I'm not sure the ideas would be completely new to you, and their authors probably wouldn't have described them as ""political theories"", but Forder argues that there is a great deal of academic work, including empirical work, that quite suddenly fell out of historical accounts of the literature.  If nothing else, I think his reference list could get you started."
4045,"OLS, Frisch-Waugh-Lovell Theorem and few observations","We know that $M_X\mathbf{u}= \mathbf{\hat u}$, where $\mathbf{y}=\mathbf{x\beta}+\mathbf{u}$. So even if the error terms are independent, the residuals will not be independent of the other residuals. This is makes the usual assumption of no autocorrelation invalid. "
4046,Inc Linear Transformation of Bernoulli Utility,"This is a subtle topic. Any strictly increasing transformation will preserve the ordering of lotteries. This is the standard result saying that utility is just an ordinal thing, we really don't care about the level of it."
4047,Difference between Value-Added TFP and Gross-Output TFP?,Your assumption is correct.  Value added is Gross Output-intermediate consumption(inputs). 
4048,"Does a stock market crash ""undo” the multiplier effect's money creation?",All price changes in the stock or commodities markets impact the money supply to the extent it results in a change in margin credit. Do note that the amount of credit itself must change and not the price alone.  A crash only has an impact if it results in net changes in the amount of credit.
4049,Serial correlation and clustered correlation in FE and FD estimators,"Yes. If the idiosyncratic error is iid, xtreg (FE) with no options (ordinary se) is valid, but the ordinary se for FD, reg d.(y x), is invalid because the differenced error is serially correlated."
4050,Deflation and positive real interest rate [duplicate],"Deflation means decreasing prices, but with the rigidity of wages (although this depends on the country in which you are), it means (i) higher unemployment rates or/and (ii) lower profits."

4054,Conversion of GDP PPP International \$ 2005 into GDP PPP International \$ 2011,"I do not know where you got the forecasts for GDP, but it is very likely they do not include a forecast on how PPPs are changing. As such, a computation of the rate of growth of GDP in 2005 PPP is a mreasure of real GDP growth."

4056,"While calcluating GNP, the overall income of a citizen working abroad is considered or only his/her remittances?",GNI (Gross National Income) is the current description of what used to be called GNP.  It is GDP (Gross Domestic Product) plus net primary income from abroad (primary income receivable from the rest of the world less primary income payable to the rest of the world)

Since they are not profits, they are not taxed."

4060,Constraints on a symmetric pareto allocation under uncertainty,"The idea is that since agents are ex-ante identical, they should have the same (ex-ante) expected utility. "
4061,Could food storage prevent a depression?,"Keep in mind that during the 7 years of famine in the Bible, there was still a negative production shock that more than likely produced a heavy recession for some of those seven years as workers tried to reallocate their labor to something more useful than agriculture. A recession merely represents a fall in final goods production. The grain that was saved up doesn't represent production for that period (rather it would be for the previous seven years of economic boom). The grain stored up represents savings rather than production."
4062,If America's economy collapsed what would happen to all of the citizens? What if the whole global economy collapsed? [closed],"There is no simple answer to this question. She is just giving her opinion on the topic. However, so long as USD is the main reserve currency for other governments and oil is mainly traded in USD, Americans can keep buying their guns at low cost. Gun laws are more detrimental to Americans' lives and hence the economy than anything else in the foreseeable future. This is my view, there is more..."

4066,"If the price of oil and energy goes down, why does CPI go up?","Canadian prices will tend to rise when energy prices fall because Canada tends to export oil and import other things. As a major oil exporter, a fall in the price of oil decreases the value of the Canadian currency— because foreigners have less need to purchase Canadian dollars with which to buy oil— causing other things to be more expensive to purchase (due to an increase in the prices of imported production inputs and finished goods)."
4067,How to find interest rates with fractional reserve banking?,"This question is sufficiently confused about basic concepts that I'm reluctant to go through the effort of clarifying everything enough to provide a meaningful answer, but here is a quick stab..."
4068,What should the value of a private sector company tell us? [closed],"A company's value, in financial terms is given by its equity, or its difference between its assets and liabilities. The well known expression $E=A-L$ reflects this. When you buy a share, you buy a part of the equity. The point is that since the world we live in is dynamic, decisions today affect outcomes tomorrow. As a result, when you buy part of this equity, you are buying part of the claims on the firms' expected future profits. The market rewards those goods that consumers demand more with a higher price and one can definitely make the argument that a firm's future profits are conditional on it producing goods/services that are valued by the public. Whether or not the goods themselves improve the lives of consumers is a separate question altogether. Do we always buy goods that improve our lives? What does that even mean? "
4069,"Stock Valuation - Interest rates, Dividends, and Shares Repurchases","We value stock if no dividends are paid, exactly for the reason you mention, we can sell them at a higher value later on. The value added to the stock if we invest the profits (would be dividends) into the company should be around the same value the dividends would pay off. However instead of paying taxes each time we get a dividend we can pay them just once when the stock is sold potentially saving on taxes."
4070,Economics and Stock Market/Bond Market,"Consider an investor who splits up his portfolio into stocks and bonds according to some ratio that considers all things that need to be considered. These include returns etc. Assume the portfolio is ""correct"" i.e. in equilibrium. Through the GDP revision, stocks become more attractive compared to bonds for the individual investor, so each individual investor has to adjust his ratios and increase the nr. of stocks, which means he has to sell bonds. The individual investor does not expect his action to actually influence government bond yields as he is small compared to the market. If all investors do this, then we get the result mentioned in the link. "
4071,Find Change in output from marginal products of labor/capital,I think your solution is golden.
4072,How did the Plaza Accord revalue the Japanese Yen?,The Plaza Accord was implemented through market mechanisms. According to Wikipedia Central banks of the signatory nations spent $10 billion dollars. They exchanged these dollars for other currencies. This increases the supply of dollars and may even decrease demand if so far the central banks have been purchasing dollars. Due to the higher supply and not higher demand the 'price' or exchange rate of the dollar fell. At the same time the countries also implemented policy changes. This would effect the mid to long term exchange rates.
4073,Price elasticity of demand in the point of economic equilibrium,Your formula is overly simplified.
4074,"What is the difference between currency manipulation, and a fixed exchange rate regime?","Correct, both a fixed exchange rate and a manipulated exchange rate involve the government setting this price. In BOTH cases it is usually implemented by promising to standing ready to buy or sell any amount at the fixed price. Of course, countries don't always have enough foreign cash to sell it at the promised price, nor do they always want to buy as much as the markets sell to them"
4075,Find quantity from price elasticity,"The good is not a giffen good. These goods have a positive elasticity of demand. Yours has a negative one, by assumption. It cannot yield a giffen good at all."
4076,Ratios to determine company's current purchasing power,"You could probably get a very good idea of a company's ability to spend money - that is, make capital investments, develop new ventures etc. - by investing its balance sheet and develop both liquidity and leverage ratios. High liquidity with low leverage means that a company is probably not investing enough. Low liquidity with high leverage ratios would indicate a company has already invested heavily and is not in a position to undertake new ventures etc. "
4077,Does price affect quantity or vice versa?,"This is a common problem among students first learning economics. The way these graphs are displayed are not meant to tell you anything about causality, let along the direction of causality. The reason that price is on the y-axis is partly because of tradition and partly because that's what makes the most sense from the perspective of developing economic theory. "

Every valuation is relative, because these valuations are made by people/by the market. For example: if you'd offer the choice between a ferrari and an icecream to a little kid, the kid might choose the icecream. If you'd offer the same choice to an adult, the adult would probably choose the ferrari. But maybe the adult is very rich, and he already has 10 such ferraris, so he doesn't care and chooses the icecream cause he's very hungry at the moment..."

4087,negative interest rate lending ripple effects,"Decreasing the nominal interest rate to a negative value will cause businesses to have to raise their prices in order to maintain 0 economic profit. This is because wages are ""sticky,"" and cannot change in a general quarterly or annual period.  People who live in the country have not been given any higher incentive to spend, but since prices are increased - aggregate demand will decrease.  Additionally, in order to survive the cut in demand and rise in prices, firms will look to lay off workers - raising unemployment.  Consumption should decrease as a result of a negative interest rate charged by the Central Bank.  In what was an attempt to increase GDP - output will decrease.  --> Stagflation is likely to occur"

If there is only one, then that's your subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium (since there are no other equilibria). If there are multiple equilibrias in the simultaneous representation, the extensive form allows you to see if some paths would never be reached given the structure of the game."

4091,Calculating Service Contributions to GDP,"Services will be calculated at the final price they are given in market. That price includes all value added items in providing the service. So, to calculate contribution of airlines in GDP, you just need to sum up the total value of tickets that are sold. Other things will automatically be counted in that."
4092,Measuring demand for banking services - (Maximum) Market Size,"There is no quantifiable answer as the concept is illusory.  Banks operate by mismatching short term debt with long term assets.  This has no benefit to the economy as a whole and in fact creates inflation, risk and volitionality.  Banks operate maturity mismatching because they can and it serves their own interest.  There is no natural demand for banks which is why they are in need of constant artificial support from central banks (much of which happens on a daily basis).  Without central bank support, banks would be accountable for mismatching short term debt with long term assets and they would quickly and rightly so burn up in a liquidity fire."

4104,Why would microeconomics be considered more “objective” than macroeconomics?,"I used to think that microeconomics was relatively more scientific than macroeconomics. Early macroeconomics, in particular, suffered from a choosing models of agent behavior that made modeling easier but bore little relationship (or at least a highly disputed relationship) with reasonable behavior of individual agents. This led to the microfoundations effort, which attempted build macroeconomic models from the ground up by modeling the behaviors of the economic agents in line with microeconomic theory (rational expectations, utility functions, life cycle effects, market power, and so on). Aligning macroeconomics with microeconomics strongly implies that microeconomics ""has it right"" and macroeconomics does not. "

4111,Intrinsic value of non-voting shares which don't pay dividends,"Just because a share doesn't presently pay dividends, doesn't mean it never will. The gamble is that eventually, it will pay dividends. So the share's value is the market's estimate of the net present value of a future cashflow discounted by two factors: one, the discount rate to reflect that this is a future cashflow not a present one; and two, the probability the cashflow will start later, or never."

But these are the same thing: both define $Q$ as a function of $q_1$ and $q_2$.

4127,Can one Calculate Fixed and Variable Cost From TC and Quantity Alone?,"As said in my comment, "
4128,How do I derive Hessian of this function and check for concavity?,"As @Herr K. stated, the beginning point is being able to take a derivative. The Hessian is a matrix equivalent to a second order derivative sometimes denoted as $\nabla^{2}$. Start by finding the gradient, $\nabla$ which is a vector of first order derivatives of every variable in the function. In your case, this would be
$$ \nabla=
  \left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
   \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{K}}  \\
   \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{L}} \\
  \end{array} } \right] =
  \left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
   aAK^{a-1}L^{b}  \\
   bAK^{a}L^{b-1} \\
  \end{array} } \right] $$
The Hessian, would be the next (second) derivative of each of the above with respect to both variables and it takes the form:
$$ \nabla^{2}=
  \left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
   \frac{\partial^{2}f}{\partial{K}^2} & \frac{\partial^{2}f}{\partial{K}\partial{L}} \\
   \frac{\partial^{2}f}{\partial{L}\partial{K}} & \frac{\partial^{2}f}{\partial{L}^2} \\
  \end{array} } \right] $$
Using whatever this would be in your case (left to you to compute) you can take the determinant of the resulting matrix and, with values for your parameters $a$ and $b$ (or at least their signs like with the other variables and parameters) you can determine whether the determinant is positive or negative and determine the concavity. If it is positive definite or positive semi-definite, this would imply either strict or non-strict convexity, respectively. If you don't know how to take a determinant it is simply dont by using a matrix say"
4129,Why did the Greek GDP grow so fast between 2002 and 2004?,"You are using USD exchange rate GDPs, which are very volatile. The main effect is probably the fact that the Euro began to circulate in 2002, replacing the cheap domestic currency."

In such a case, nominal interest rates will adjust to inflation, and so the loan repayments will increase to a degree from that channel, although the nominal value of the debt principal will not change.

You give a bank your signature on a loan contract and they give you something that will allow you to buy real stuff (houses, cars, whatever).  You enjoy this real stuff for some time. Then at the end you have to give the bank something that will allow them to buy real stuff, only more of it.  I'm calling it ""something"" instead of ""dollars"" for a reason I will explain below."
4137,What is a suitable exponential to model a currency or cryptocurrency price increase?,There are assumptions in your thinking that probably are not valid.

One may also argue that the depositors should know the risks and if their bank makes bad investments it is partly their fault so they cannot complain should they lose their deposits. But a functioning banking system is essential to the current economic system. The bankruptcy of a big bank would cause panic and banks runs, which because of fractional reserve banking would probably result in the insolvency of other banks, banks that perhaps made good investments but ones that cannot immediately be liquidated. After the closing of the banks considerably less savings would be deposited in financial institutions. This will hinder consumption because credit/debit card traffic would cease and getting investment funds would also be considerably more difficult."
4146,Can a market function if everyone has the same preferences,"Even if everyone's preferences are exactly the same, as long as you leave diminishing marginal utility (e.g. each person would rather have nonzero proportions of apples and bananas rather than exclusively apples or exclusively bananas) and the advantage of division of labor (e.g. a farmer can produce more apples or more bananas if he focuses exclusively on growing one of those rather than trying to grow some of both), there will still be trade because people will want to maximize the value they accumulate by specializing their labor, but possess that value in the form of a wider variety of goods than their (efficiently allocated) labor produces."

4151,Why are so many pharmaceutical drugs so expensive? [closed],"Prices are high because drug firms have monopoly power, granted to them by the patent system. In addition the demand for the drugs is fairly inelastic because once you fall seriously ill you're often willing to pay a high price for the cure. If your insurance covers it, you won't even directly notice the price. So the companies can charge almost any price."
4152,What does these “strategy notations” mean?,"The above post is pretty close (+1), but has not mentioned the subgame perfect Nash Equilibrium and the notation $s_2^*=8-s_1^*$ might be misleading, as it implies that player 2's Nash Equilibrium strategy is a function of $s_1$, which would mean the best response for player 1 could not be anything less than 8. "
4153,utility function always negative,"As discussed in comments above, this should be $U(c)=-\frac{1}{2}(c^* - c)^2$. The economic intuition is that c* is the ""bliss"" consumption level.  It is probably your first glimpse at the idea of ""satiation"", which is an extension of the idea of diminishing marginal utility which allows discussion of situations where additional consumption actually produces disutility.  The most obvious example is the consumption of food, where c* would be the point at which you get ""full"".  But there are other contexts involving the study of externalities, where satiation is important, such as in environmental economics.  "

He puts a special emphasis on general equilibrium considerations. He discusses why counterfactual analysis based on microdata that ignores general equilibrium issues may lead to misleading conclusions. In particular, depending on magnitudes of various effects, general equilibrium interactions can offset or even reverse sensible partial equilibrium conclusions."

4166,Example production function with increasing returns to scale but diminishing marginal product [duplicate],"Decreasing marginal returns to a factor means that keeping the other factors fixed, the marginal output generated by this factor is decreasing. When looking at returns to scale, we change all outputs. Increasing a factor with decreasing marginal returns can have an indirect effect in increasing the marginal productivity of other factors. If we increase all factors at the same time, the indirect effects may outweigh the direct effect. The production function $F:\mathbb{R}_+^2$ given by
$$F(x,y)=(x+1)^{2/3}(y+1)^{2/3}$$
has decreasing marginal factor productivities everywhere but not decreasing returns to scale (it doesn't have increasing returns to scale either)."

4175,Computing the core in a transferrable utility game,"It depends on the set of feasible allocations for the coalitions $S$. Suppose for all $S$ a best allocation exists (the sum of the individual utilities of the members of $S$ is maximal). Then as in usual cooperative games each coalition can be assigned this best utility sum as its value $v(S)$. Let us denote the utility vector each player gets from an allocation by $x$, and the sum of utilites players get from this by $x(S)$. An allocation is in the core iff
$$
\forall S\subseteq N: x(S) \geq v(S).
$$ 
This is a slight simplification of what you wrote, because instead of comparing all allocations to $x$ we first find the 'best' allocations for each coalition and only compare these to $x$."

Under the 2008 System of National Accounts (the international standard for calculating GDP), overseas shipping is generally to be allocated on the basis of the ports out of which the fleet is serviced. See 4.13, on page 62. The document to which it refers is the Sixth Edition of the IMF's Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual.

Similarly, roughly 10% of global GDP is on energy expenditure, and about the same on food, but if we stopped either of those, global GDP drops to pretty much zero."

It uses the notion of cardinality of sets, in particular, the different cardinalities between the rationals and the reals, which are some of the first things one learns in a real analysis course. "
4200,Whats the math behind calculating the price of cryptocurrency through supply and demand?,"Prices are set the same way as in any other market, which is to say that there is a (continuous, ongoing) process of tâtonnement where (say) buyers find that they cannot purchase at the maximum price they are willing to pay, or sellers find that they cannot sell at the minimum price they are willing to accept, creating pressure to adjust those prices. In some markets, this will eventually lead to relatively stable prices (say, street food), while in others, prices are more volatile, depending on how elastic supply and demand are."
4201,Cournot's game profit maximisation first order condition question,To elaborate on @HerrK’s comment:
4202,Why inflation is still reported low?,"There's a pretty simple answer to that.  The money injected into the banking system does not acquire any velocity- it just gets redeposited at the Fed.  If they had spent the same amount of money into the general economy in the form of goods and services, then you would have seen higher inflation.  "
4203,Can a progressive marginal taxation be regressive in terms of average tax rate?,"In comments it was clarified that $T(Y) = 0$ and continuity are not assumed. In this case there are several counterexamples, a relatively simple one being

\begin{array}{ll} 
1 + 20\%Y & \text{if } Y \leq 5 \\
40\% Y & \text{if } Y > 5.
\end{array}
\right. 
$$
Here the taxation is progressive, but the average tax rate $T(Y)/Y$ is close to infinite near $Y = 0$ as
$$
\lim_{Y \to 0} \frac{1}{Y} + 20\% = \infty,
$$
and $T(Y)/Y$ is smaller later, e.g. $T(5)/5 = 2/5$."
4204,mixted strategy that assigns positive weight to a pure startegy that is dominated,"The short answer is that a mixed strategy $\sigma_i$ that uses with positive probability a dominated pure strategy $s_i$ can always be improved by excluding $s_i$ from its mixing support and redistributing its ""probability weight"" to one of its dominating strategies."
4205,The TYPICAL law of motion of capital,"$k_t$ is your capital after investment, so if you subtract the capital you carried over from last period, $k_{t-1}(1-\delta)$, you obtain the amount that must have been invested in order to have $k_t$ of capital today. "
4206,Expected Utility with expected value and variance,"While it is true that a function has the expected utility form if and only if it is linear (in probabilities), it is not the case that any linear function can represent a preference that satisfies the vNM axioms. The expected utility theorem simply says that when a preference satisfies the vNM axioms, there exists a linear utility function that represents it. The theorem does not say, in particular, that all linear utility function represents a preference that satisfies the axioms. "

4210,The concept of information structure in incomplete information games,"The two formulations are equivalent in the sense that if every type of player always learns the state of the world, there is no uncertainty and there is really no need to carry around the realized state as a variable.

This would highlight if we use deductive logic that our trade agreements with Germany, AND France were not good agreements because the Trade was one sided (not a mutual flow). They produce a car for example, we produce nothing. Modern economic theory teaches us that society faces a trade off between production and consumption. Consume a lot now, consume much less later, because you must produce to increase your future consumption. "
4225,Econometrics: Omitting a significant variable,It is important to recognize that there are path dependencies to removing different variables from your model.

It does not matter if your production function takes one input or $N$ inputs. All that matters is how inputs behave within the function itself. Another way to think about this is to consider that a production function with a single input can exhibit decreasing, constant, or increasing returns to scale. "

  is materialised only in their consumption, and their consumption may
  necessitate a change of location of these things, hence may require an
  additional process of production, in the transport industry. The
  productive capital invested in this industry imparts value to the
  transported products, partly by transferring value from the means of
  transportation, partly by adding value through the labour performed in
  transport. This last-named increment of value consists, as it does in
  all capitalist production, of a replacement of wages and of
  surplus-value.  "

4247,Updated International patent protection index from Park (2008),"Apparently not. A 2015 article by the author uses his index to evaluate economic growth across country and time, stopping in 2005, same as the index in the original paper. And yet, many of the other variables are in principle available for more recent years. "

4249,What's the name for this type of non zero sum game?,"A zero-sum game is so named because in it, the sum of the players' payoffs is always zero. Unless you provide a specific payoff structure to the players in the game, it's hard to categorize it. From what you've described, I suggest you look up the term constant-sum game and see if it is something you're looking for. "
4250,Has worker productivity decreased since the election of Donald Trump?,"I think it's too early to identify econometrically an effect of Trump in the economy. Recall that the election was the 8th of November, and his victory came partly as a surprise. He took some time to define his cabinet and got into office the 22nd of January. Thus, any effect of a Trump's ""dummy"" might only partially be reflected in data for Q4 of 2016, and perhaps not fully in Q1 2017. The release of (worker's productivity) for Q2 2017 is the 9th of July (soon), where we might see more of Trump's effect on the economy and productivity."

4253,"How to derive the demand function of $U(x_1,x_2)=x_1-x_2$","Some economics problems are deisgned to help us practice the basic tools (e.g., optimisation) of the trade. Others are designed to force us to think about the mechanics of a problem to help us understand the underlying economics better."
4254,Why do we want MSB = MSC not MSB > MSC?,"Remember that the M in MSB standard for marginal. In other words, the marginal social benefit is the extra benefit we would get by increasing the activity by one unit and the marginal social cost is the extra cost we would get by increasing the activity by one unit."
4255,Can a firm have a negative turnover during a period of time?,"One possible circumstance relates to firms undertaking long term contracts (eg for building or engineering work). Where a contract is uncompleted at the end of a period, the firm may (depending on its accounting policies) include in its turnover an amount reflecting its assessment of the work in progress.  Sometimes unforeseen difficulties in completing a contract will subsequently come to light, and it may become necessary to include an offsetting reduction within turnover for the next period. If the contract is a large proportion of the firm's activity, then this could result in overall turnover for that period being negative."
4256,Can lying be disincentivized without serious curtailments of free speech?,"If free speech is narrowly defined to only include true claims, true and false claims can be perfectly distinguished, the harm of false claims perfectly measured, and all claims are either true or false, then false claims are really no different than other forms of pollution. A standard pigovian tax should internalize the externalities and encourage the socially optimal level of truth telling. The social planner just has to tax each lie enough to discourage the social harm it does."
4257,Is cash(currency) a security and a debt instrument?,"I don't think cash could be described as a security... one of the characteristics of securities is that they have imperfect (if very high) liquidity and provide a return (be it fixed or variable). Cash is the definition of liquid and inherently provides no return - you could earn interest on cash by depositing it in a bank but then you are creating a debt obligation in effect - the cash inherently, as in cash in a physical safe, generates zero return nominal by definition. You could think of cash as a debt security where a debt is theoretically placed on the issuer. But: in practice the debt is impossible to pay. You cannot bring a bill into the fed and demand they honour it. So I suppose it would be a debt security in the theoretical sense but it lacks almost all properties of debt securities:
cannot be repaid in practice, never intended to be repaid, perfectly liquid etc, and it has a value that cannot be expressed in terms of anything but itself. "

4259,Diminishing returns and economies of scale,"In production with more than one input, ""diminishing returns"" refers to what happens when we increase one input while keeping all the rest constant. ""Economies of scale"" is a more informal term for ""increasing returns to scale"" and so relates to what happens when we increase all inputs by the same proportion (while, and this is important, we keep the technology unchanged)."

4262,How to tax the robots?,"Robot taxation is a bit like corporate income taxation. Like corporations, robots don't pay taxes, people pay taxes. In the words of Herb Stein:"
4263,Why switch from Gold to Fiat,"When recession strikes, it's prone to the currency equivalent of ""bank runs"" where everyone attempts to trade in their paper money for gold at once, causing a drastic reduction in the money supply, rising of interest rates, and the dreaded deflationary spiral. In the face of a recession, you want the opposite to happen."
4264,Questions on supply curve,"Question 1 That's a reasonable way to think about it,but maybe missing out on a bit of nuance.  Realize that at any given price, the supply curve indicates how much WILL be supplied.  You are correct that if the price drops, the supplier will no longer be willing to supply that quantity of a good.  But likewise, if price increase, the supply will seek to supply a greater quantity."
4265,What effect would destroying large amounts of physical currency have on government finances,"In most modern economies, the central bank certainly has the authority to print money, when it does so to implement its legally defined objective. Let's consider what the implications of this 'elimination' of cash are."
4266,Determining whether preferences are rational given a utility function,"As long as a preference can be represented by a continuous utility function, it is rational (and continuous). So from the very fact that you're writing down a utility function that is continuous in both $x$ and $y$ (on $(0,\infty)^2$), it follows that the function represents a rational preference (provided that both $x$ and $y$ are positive). "
4267,The independence of Central Banks [closed],The independence of the central bank means that the bank is independent of the government. A mandate of the central bank is to ensure price stability. However any excess cash the bank prints is the property of the government. The government enjoys having extra income and were it allowed to exercise direct control it may push the bank to print more money. This would undermine the price stability mandate of the bank. Hence in most countries they give the central bank leadership that is independent of the government.
4268,Will price increase as demand increase?,"The law of demand is a microeconomic law that states, all other factors being equal, as the price of a good or service increases, consumer demand for the good or service will decrease, and vice versa."
4269,Is a home (primary residence) purchase a form of investment in macroeconomics?,"Home construction is a form of investment, home purchase is not. There's an important macro difference between creating the capital asset (construction) and transferring it (purchase)."

4271,What Taylor approximation is used in this equation?,"Even though your question does not allow a definite answer, I am pretty sure the author used a Taylor expansion around the logarithm of both sides of the equation. This process is called log-linearization, and is fairly common."
4272,Depreciating companies intangible assets [closed],"All assets which have a finite useful life are depreciated. For example, your patents or copyright might hold for 5 or 10 years but no more. Thus, it is quite coherent to reflect the loss of value through depreciation and amortization. Same goes for a software for example: in 5 years time, a software might be obsolete, so we need to reflect this in the financial statements."
4273,What is the difference between knowledge-based and R&D?,A knowledge-based company sells products or services that are primarily knowledge-based. This doesn't have to be new knowledge - it can be existing knowledge.

4276,possible Heteroskedasticity?,"The question should be: Does there appear to be enough heteroskedasticity so that not taking it into account would lower the quality of inference? And this is because ""taking heteroskedasticity into account"" (even if only for robust standard errors) is not without costs -with small sample sizes it may worsen the reliability of results. And it becomes even riskier if you want to implement the more traditional approach where you will specify a functional relationship between the error variances and the regressors."
4277,Why currency purchasing power is linked to confidence in central banks,"TL;DR Version: 
The trust that money has value gives it its value. If money can be exchanged for gold, then this makes people trust that it will have value. If this is not the case (and it is not, although it used to be the case almost everywhere) then the only thing that can make people trust that money will not lose its value through extreme printing of money is having trustworthy people endowed with the power to print money. These people are called central bankers, hence their credibility matters here. The consequences of losing faith would be (hyper-)inflation."
4278,Proving the asymptotic normality of th Non-linear Least Squares estimator,"It appears that what you do is not a Taylor expansion, but an application of the mean-value theorem (as one should). If it was a Taylor expansion, apart from the remainder, the gradient would have to be evaluated at $\beta_0$. With the mean-value theorem, there is no remainder, and you evaluate the gradient at some $\bar \beta$ that always lies between $\beta$ and $\hat \beta$.  "

4281,Measuring “Intangible Utility” (reference request/methodological discussion),"This is just a follow-up on denesp's comment. In economics, the utility is a tool used to represent choices, and therefore the right way of measuring the individual's utility from listening to the song is to elicit his willingness to pay for it. This can be done by a Becker-DeGroot-Marschak mechanism that eliminates moral hazard. Note that this refers to ex-ante anticipated utility."
4282,On closedness: commodity space,"A closed set does not need to be bounded. For instance, the set $[0,\infty)$ is closed but unbounded."
4283,Are supply and demand always (with arbitrary dimensions but still) linear?,"Absolutely not, linear curves are a simplification made for (many) basic economics courses. When considering the basic mechanisms of Supply and Demand (supply rises when the price rises, demand drops when the price rises, etc.) there is no need to use more complicated curves, but as soon as you introduce elements like optimization, it is in many cases necessary to use non-linear functions."
4284,Relationship between trade deficit and borrowing,"A) You are right! Its not necessarily ""borrowing"". People say that only as way of speaking. You could sell your foreign exchange reserves, or sell other foreign assets, or sell local assets. "
4285,Will Chinese yuan be a key international currency someday?,"""SDR inclusion does not mean... that the renminbi will rival the dollar as an international currency, at least not any time soon. The dollar is widely used globally in trade, in international borrowing and lending, and as the principal currency for official reserve holdings (about sixty percent of global reserves are held in dollars). Importantly, the dollar’s global status is a market outcome, not the result of a decision by any international body or of an international agreement. Private investors and governments freely choose to hold dollars because the markets for dollar-denominated assets are, by far, the deepest and most liquid of any currency; because the United States imposes no restrictions on capital flows in or out of the country; because of the quality of U.S. financial regulation; because the Federal Reserve has kept inflation low and stable for the past thirty years; and because the United States is large, prosperous, and politically stable."" "
4286,Concept of absolute advantage,"Say two countries have the same amount of resources. A has an absolute advantage relative to B if A has technology such that A produces a larger quantity of output using that given level of resources relative to B. So, lets say potatoes are inputs and mashed potatoes are outputs. A has an absolute advantage in mashed potato production if it can produce more pounds of mashed potatoes than B. Comparative advantage, on the other hand, deals with the opportunity cost. For example, the french fries foregone by each country when they decide to produce mashed potatoes. "

4288,"If a business charges more for a product than the cost to make it, how is our economy not inevitably doomed for debt?","To continue your example: 
Resources (including labor) cost $x$, product sells for 4$x$. The fat cat business owner makes 3$x$. What does he do with it? If he spends it, for example plays golf or gets his hair done then the people providing those services get the money. Thus there need not be debt, the hairdresser can use these earnings to buy the product the fat cat's business was selling. The usual water analogy is of a circulatory system: water (money) flows from one vessel to the other."

4290,Put Call Parity,"How about a hint rather than an exact answer? Put Call Parity concerns the relationship between the prices of European put and call options (with matched strike and expiration dates):
$$ C - P = D(F-K) $$
where C and P are the current prices of calls and puts respectively, D is the discount factor, F is the forward price of the asset, and K is the strike price. "
4291,Book recommendation: agent based modeling?,Another book that comes to mind (in keeping with the 1 book per answer guideline) is the Quant-Econ book that is being put together by Tom Sargent and John Stachurski. This book is a little more geared towards programming than John's Economic Dynamics book and can be found (for free) online at http://quant-econ.net/.
4292,An increase in Japan's demand for US goods would cause the value of dollar to appreciate?,"You're just intermediating. The US companies would still have to pay their workers in USD, therefor, instead of the Japanese companies buying dollars in your scenario, the exporters are using the importers' Yen to buy dollars."
4293,How does the monopoly's deadweight loss affect market surplus and the economic pie?,Consider the following two examples:
4294,What is considered a “final product” for gross domestic product?,"Since you're asking a question about the value-added approach to calculating GDP, the answer that follows talks about the value-added approach. It's worth noting, however, that GDP can (and is) also calculated through two other approaches: the expenditure approach and the income approach. In the US, the value-added approach is used primarily in the GDP-by-industry accounts."
4295,Do banks pay for deposit insurance?,"There's additional information in this answer, but in the US, banks pay into the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund, and regulation and capital requirements are used to stop banks from taking excessive risks with deposits. In the event of a bank failure, depositors below the insured limit are repaid in full, but equity-holders are generally wiped out and other creditors must often take losses as well. "
4296,Floating exchange rate and cost-push inflation?,"The passage quoted is (at least) sloppy as regards language, in that it writes first ""relatively less expensive"", and then uses ""even more"", which would be correct if previously it had described a ""more"" expensive rather than a ""less"" expensive situation.  "
4297,Is there any fundamental reason that output elasticity of capital $<1$ in general?,The elasticity of output with respect to capital will be less than 1 due to the diminishing marginal returns of capital - this is both realistic on macroeconomic scale and also one of the central assumptions of the model.
4298,Is there any up-to-date list of hours of work needed to buy a Big Mac?,"I could not find any more recent Big Mac Index in terms of hours worked, and I dont think it is avaiable as wage statistics is usually reported with 1-2 year lag in many countries, but the Economist provides the Big Mac Index in USD, EUR, GBP and few other currencies up to January 2020  and it is being kept up to date with about 1 quarter lag. You can find the index here and raw data for all years here. "

4300,Understanding GDP Chart,What you are seeing in the data provided in the google search is an annual estimate  of GDP.  In the FRED data download is GDP reported on a quarterly basis.
4301,Contract theory: Incentive contracts (when agents have multiple tasks) models by G. Baker and Holmstrom & Milgrom,"Holmström and Milgrom assume that the agent exhibits constant absolute risk aversion. This implies that if you change the total wage of the agent with a lump sum transfer (that does not depend on effort), you will not change the incentives. Hence, to find the optimal contract, you can find the contract that maximizes total surplus subject to incentive compatibility, and then subtract a lump sum amount to make the agent indifferent between accepting and not. "
4302,Recover cost function from profit function,I suggest that you ask yourself the following questions:
4303,GDP Discrepancies,The data presented in the BEA website are percent change at annual rates (https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=19&step=2#reqid=19&step=2&isuri=1&1921=survey   )
4304,Mathematics of the income and substitution effects,"The (Hicks-) substitution effect is by definition the change in consumption of X induced by a change of the relative prices, holding utility fixed. Thus, the original budget line is ""rolled along"" its indifference curve until it has the same slope (same relative prices) as the actual budget constraint after the price change. This determines $e'$. You can think of the tangent to $e'$ as a hypothetical budget constraint that compensates you for the lost utility resulting from the increasing price of $X$ by adding income until you can just afford a bundle with the same utility as the original bundle $e$. In total, the change from $e$ to $e^*$ is then separated into a change from $e$ to $e'$, (rolling the budget line along the indifference curve: relative price change, holding utility constant = substitution effect) and a change from $e'$ to $e^*$ (parallel shift of budget line: income change, holding relative prices constant = income effect)."
4305,Why labor-augmenting technological progress increases employment and wages?,"I found this excellent Economic Letter from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco that speaks to this observation. It is from Carl R. Walsh (july 16,2004) (https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2004/july/the-productivity-and-jobs-connection-the-long-and-the-short-run-of-it/  )"
4306,"If a call may expire OTM, why won't a \$1 increase in the underlying's price necessarily increase the call's price by \$1?",The reason that a call option price does not increase one-to-one with spot price of the underlying stock is simple: A 1 dollar increase in stock price only increases the likelihood that the option will be ITM. It is not a guarantee of 1 dollar increase in payoff at maturity. Naturally the price of call does not increase by 1 dollar. 
4307,How does the GDP multiplier work?,"The multiplier comes from the solution to the goods market equilibrium. In economics everything is endogenous. Increase in income increases consumption that increases demand, demand increases production and production increases income. However, as an echo in a cave the initial increase in income gets 'weaker' as it cycles through the economy and the result 1/MPS tells you how much after accounting for the above mentioned cycle 1e increase in for example government spending increases the output. "
4308,Why did coronavirus cause a food shortage?,"This question is too open-ended, as it does not even specify a country. There are a number of issues that have shown up. These comments are based on my reading of news stories, and arguably not authoritative."
4309,Best response correspondences game theory,"Let $\pi_L(p,q) = 3pq + p(1-q) + 2(1-p)(1-q)$ denote the expected payoff of the lecturer. The best response is defined as $BR_L(q) = \arg\max_{p \in [0,1]}\pi_L(p,q)$.
Now, note that 
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial \pi_L(p,q)}{\partial p}
\begin{cases}
> 0 \quad& \text{for } q > 1/4,\\
= 0 & \text{for } q = 1/4,\\
< 0 & \text{for } q < 1/4.
\end{cases}
\end{align}
For $q>1/4$ the payoffs are strictly increasing in $p$ such that $p = 1$ is optimal.
For $q=1/4$ the payoffs are constant in $p$ such that any $p \in [0,1]$ is optimal.
For $q<1/4$ the payoffs are strictly decreasing in $p$ such that $p = 0$ is optimal.
Same logic applies to The Catalan."
4310,Why does an increasing demand for dollars lead to the depreciation of a currency?,"I am by no means an expert in monetary policy, but this is how I understand it. An increasing demand for dollars implies that more people want to trade the local currency for dollars. The supply of the local currency then increases while demand for it decreases, implying that the currency will depreciate."
4311,Prices set by firms are the same in a Salop circle. But why?,tl;dr: Prices are identical because firms are identical.
4312,How is GDP counted between different countries?,"I think the only answer to this is that you need to read a guide on GDP calculations. Link to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which calculates US GDP."
4313,Is there still allocative efficiency when a subsidy is placed on a good?,"allocative efficiency occurs whenever total market surplus is maximized. This occurs whenever price is equal to the ‘free market’ equilibrium price. There is no surplus of goods at this equilibrium price. There is no DWL at this equilibrium. If there exists DWL, the market is not operating at the 'free market' (as phrased in a comment below) or the ‘unfettered’ equilibrium and the market is not allocatively efficient. To be clear, this market will still operate at some equilibrium. However, this equilibrium will not be efficient. "
4314,Python vs R (vs Stata): the old battle revisited,I use all three programs.
4315,Should unemployment caused by the government closing non-essential businesses during quarantine be counted as structrural unemployment?,"There are lots of different people unemployed, and the answer will be different depending on the person. In your prostitute example, if you left your medical assistant job because prostitution paid more, then it's frictional, because there are lots of medical assistant jobs, but it might take you time to go through the interview process and be onboarded. If you have no marketable skills other than sex work, then it's structural unemployment. If there is another job that you're qualified, but you don't get the job because there are so many other people competing for it, then it's cyclical (which is a bit of a misleading term, since there it's not like there's a ""quarantine/no quarantine"" cycle, at least not yet, fingers crossed)."
4316,How does a mortgage-backed security issued by a bank allows it to borrow cheaper and make more loans?,Here are two ways by which selling mortgage-backed securities (MBS) benefited banks:
4317,Negative real rates on yield curve,"Investors are not paying to hold Treasury bonds (yet), nominal yields are still positive (but that could change...). All that is happening is that inflation-protected securities are guaranteeing a return less than CPI inflation."
4318,Question about Federal reserve open market operations - reducing money supply,"Have you ever gifted your parents a ""I'll wash the house"" ticket? Or maybe your parents just forced you to do it. In any case, money, or less colloquially a Federal Reserve note, is like a ""I'll wash the house"" ticket issued by the Federal Reserve. But instead of being able to redeem it for a house wash, you can redeem it to receive a certain amount of gold. That is if you lived pre-1971 (edit: pre-1933). Now you can't redeem it for anything, but it doesn't change the fact that Federal Reserve notes are a liability to the Federal Reserve. "
4319,How do different Indifference Curves relate to each other?,"Each indifference Curve represents a different set of indifferences for different bundles of goods. Assuming the three Indifference curves are labeled I1, I2, I3, with I1 being the bottom one and I3 being the top one. "
4320,Will a shift in the average total cost curve mean that the marginal cost curve will also shift up?,"No, a shift in the average total cost curve does not necessarily mean that the marginal cost curve will also shift up."
4321,Does the minimum of short-run average cost equal the minimum of long-run average cost in the long run for perfect competition?,"So to understand why the long run average cost curve and short run average cost curve  have the same minimum in perfect competition, as well as some of the other stuff you ask, you have to understand the different assumptions that underlie the models you're working with."
4322,What would be the likely economic consequences of the “trillion dollar coin” idea to eliminate all government debt?,"Quite obviously, the act of creating and depositing the coin can't possibly impact anything of economic interest (except for creating an imperceptibly small increase in demand for platinum and hence an imperceptibly small increase in its price)."
4323,What is the difference between HM Treasury and HM Exchequer?,Collection of tax revenue in the UK is the responsibility of neither of those but of HM Revenue & Customs which has the status of a non-ministerial department. 
4324,What would be the income tax rate be if it were 'flattened'?,"Having worked on these issues myself for quite some time, I am not aware of any study on this for New Zealand. For a back-of-the-envelope calculation of the revenue-neutral flat tax rate, you'd need the following:"
4325,"Check for concavity, quasi-concavity with given value of function","First look at the shape of the indifference curves. (I assume that $f$ is a utility function here.) The better-sets are convex, so this is consistent with quasi-concavity of the function $f$."
4326,After how many years will loan be paid with constant payment,Some of your equations are wrong and you need to account for the time value of money correctly in some places. It might be useful to write down a timeline and make sure to bring all payments to the same point in time (let's take time 0 as our reference)
4327,What is the purpose of multiple regression?,"The difference is that the first regression is unbiased only if you can assume that high school GPA and ACT score are orthogonal on each other $cov(x,z)=0$ where $x$ is shortcut for high school GPA and $z$ for ACT score. Or if you can assume the second variable ATC score does not affect the dependent variable at all $\beta_2=0$. This is because in simple regression the $\beta$ coefficient bias is given by:"
4328,why did the 2008 financial crisis happen inspite of banks having 85% insurance on deposits in U.S.?,"Yes, most of the loans were insured - this is called a credit default swap (CDS) that an insurance company insures a bank loan in case of a default (i.e. when a borrower cannot repay, the insurer pays the bank).  Banks and insurance companies were making an unprecedented amount of money through this practice."
4329,Existence of a subgame perfect Nash-equilibrium,The following proposition is well known: 
4330,Definition of covered market,A market is covered if all consumers will choose to buy from at least one of the firms at the prevailing prices.
4331,Is there any overlap between evolutionary and behavioral game theory,I don't think behavioral game theory is inspired much by biology. Rather it's motivated by the discrepancies between theoretical predictions and the choices observed in lab experiments. It seeks to improve the predictive accuracy of game theoretic models by introducing behavioral assumptions that allow players to behave in ways different from the traditional Bayesian rational benchmark. 
4332,Model of economic cycles consistent with efficient market hypothesis,If you want some simple model of stock prices consistent with efficient market hypothesis it would be random walk:
4333,Why traditional banks tend not to provide finance to the poor?,This is actually heavily studied question in development economics. Here are some common answers:
4334,"If the players are symmetric and the core is nonempty, then $x_i = v(N)/n$ for all $i$ is a Core element","The center allocation $z_{i}:=(v(N)/|N|)$ for all $i \in N$ is in the core of the symmetric game $v$, whenever $z(S) = \sum_{i \in S} z_{i} \ge v(S) $ holds for all $S \subseteq N$. Now, if $v(N)/|N| \ge v(S)/|S|$ for all $S \subseteq N$, then it holds $z(S) = \sum_{i \in S} z_{i} = |S|\cdot v(N)/|N| \ge v(S)$. Thus, $\mathbf{z} \in C(v)$.  "
4335,Linear Probability Model Instead of Logit in Fixed Effects Regression,"FE logit requires the idiosyncratic errors to be IID across $i$ and $t$, quite a strong assumption. Also the regressors should be strictly exogenous, but it's the same for linear FE models. In your application, the fact that FE logit wouldn't converge will make a good argument against FE logit, and will satisfy some referees but not all."
4336,Can I Upload my Preprint on Arxiv Before Submitting it to JPE,"Most papers I have read in the JPE circulated in form of preprint before (not on arxiv, but this should not be an important point). See for instance https://ideas.repec.org if you want to find examples of working papers later published in JPE:"
4337,Equity-efficiency tradeoff examples,"Publicly funded healthcare and social welfare schemes typically serve redistributive functions and therefore can be considered as promoting equity (among the well-off and the poor). At the same time, these programs must be financed through taxation such as income tax that's usually distortive, thereby weighing down on efficiency."
4338,What would happen if fractional banking was phased out? [duplicate],Fractional banking acts as a multiplier on the money available for loan takers.
4339,Why does the profit function in standard neoclassical theory have exactly one maximum?,"Mathematically, most neoclassical  models assume that the profits are concave. This guaranties the uniqueness of the maximum. In economic terms, the Neoclassical theory usually assumes that the law of diminishing returns holds. Thus, the more you hire workers, the more you produce, but at a diminishing rate. "
4340,Why can we write any lottery as a convex combination of the degenerate lotteries?,"Pick any set of non-negative $p_1,\dots,p_n$ such that $p_1+\cdots+p_n=1$. The convex combination of degenerate lotteries $L^1,\dots,L^n$ with the $p_i$'s can be written as 
\begin{align}
p_1L^1+\cdots+p_nL^n&=p_1(1,0,\dots,0)+\cdots+p_n(0,\dots,0,1)\\
&=\bigl(p_1(1)+p_2(0)+\cdots+p_n(0),\;\dots,\;p_1(0)+\cdots+p_{n-1}(0)+p_n(1)\bigr)\\
&=(p_1,\dots,p_n).
\end{align}
This is just a lottery $L=(p_1,\dots,p_n)$."
4341,What idea was proposed to remove global poverty?,"Unlike many Nobel prizewinners, this year's award was not really given for a central theoretical development. All three of the winners have made important theoretical contributions relevant to development economics and that inspired their future work (for example Banerjee on networks or Kremer on technological change and productivity). However, their major contribution, and what they received the award for, is their major methodological contributions."

4343,"Why exchange rates of national currency are usually stable, where as cryptocurrency like bitcoin and ethereum is highly volatile?","The value of currencies (including most popular cryptocurrencies) is set by a market. If more people want to sell the currency (i.e., exchange it for a different currency) than to buy it then some of the sellers will be unable to find a buyer. Their only option will be to lower the price they demand until someone is willing to buy."

4350,Difference between social choice function and mechanism outcome function,"A social choice function presumes the individuals' preference parameters $\theta_i$'s are observable, whereas in a mechanism, such knowledge is not presupposed. Therefore, in a mechanism, the arguments of the outcome function are strategies of the players, which are observable, not their preference parameters, which, although indirectly determine the players' strategies, are not observable. "
4351,What is the interpration of results if adding or subtracting a control variable effects the significance of explanotary variables?,"When you run a regression you are making the assumptions of the Gauss Markov Theorem, one of which is that the error is uncorrelated with all of the independent variables (exogeneity)."
4352,Maximin utility function,Gilboa and Schmeidler (1989) is the canonical reference for such a function. The paper provides an axiomatic foundation for such a function being used to represent a maximin preference. 
4353,What is the iff condition for a preference with linear Engel curves (all Engal curves are linear)?,"Are negative incomes (perhaps even negative prices) also allowed? Unless they are, non-horizontal or non-vertical lines are impossible as Engel curves because they have to intersect the negative quadrant of the coordinate system. I will come back to this later."
4354,"Is it possible to repay the world debt? If not, why do we care?",So there are a couple of things you want to consider:
4355,Pareto Efficient level of Public Good,"The social welfare maximizing outcome you computed (by equating the sum of marginal benefits to marginal cost) is just one of the Pareto efficient outcomes. Although maximization of joint utilities is a sufficient condition for Pareto efficiency, it is not a necessary condition. Pareto efficiency is defined by the lack of Pareto improvement -- a reallocation of resources to make at least someone better off without making any other worse off. "
4356,Are opportunity costs synonymous with economic costs?,"In economics, we argue that there is only one correct way to think of costs. And so, the adjectives economic or opportunity in front of the word cost are actually superfluous — the terms cost, true cost, economic cost, and opportunity cost are all exact synonyms."
4357,Are there import taxes between US states?,"No. Such interstate taxes are prohibited by the Commerce Clause as they would be ""undue burdens on interstate commerce""."
4358,Is inconclusive region in durbin watson a problem?,"There are cases error serial correlation is a disaster. For example, if your model is $y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 y_{t-1} + u_t$, then serial correlation in $u_t$ means correlation of $y_{t-1}$ and $u_t$ (in general) and your OLS estimator is biased and inconsistent. In other cases, serial correlation does not cause endogeneity and OLS is still consistent. An example is the case the right-hand side variable is strictly exogenous. Then you can use OLS and heteroskedasticity and auto-correlation consistent (HAC) inferences, e.g., using the Newey-West standard errors."
4359,Extraction of Inflation Expectation from bond yields,"Yes, the number you give is an approximation. If you wanted to calculate the true economic breakeven, you would need to include the effect of the lag used in the indexation process (which includes known inflation information), coupon cash flows, seasonality of inflation, etc. If there is a maturity mismatch, then you would need to decide how to handle that as well."
4360,Protectionism and smaller countries,"There are sometimes cases where protectionist trade policies are a good thing. (note this is a big debate, so a bit of bias here). 
Lets look at an example to make it clear...
Suppose I'm country A and you are country B.
I'm a small country, you are a large one.
My country is 100% agriculture based. Your country is completely diverse and strong in all sectors. 
My country realizes it is time to diversify and become more integrated into the global economy/market. Instead of just agriculture based products, my country wants to also sell computer monitors.
Here is where the problem occurs, if my country just starts producing computer monitors and try's to sell them, people will just continue to buy your countries computer monitors because they are better quality and probably cheaper in price due to comparative advantage. So now what? What must my country do to compete with yours, and grow? Well if my country makes your products more expensive, (aka a tariff) less people will buy your monitors and more people will buy mine (only in my country). This would allow my computer monitor(tech) sector to grow on it's own, without a big bully competitor(your country in this scenario) forcing me out before I even get started. 
Over time once my tech sector has grown enough to compete with yours, I would lower/get rid of the tariffs and be better off."

4362,Can consumer surplus be negative if a consumer is forced to make a purchase?,"Consumer surplus is their willingness to pay minus the price they pay,  and producer surplus is the price they receive minus their willingness to receive. So if you are assuming that consumers are forced to buy at a price of 100, yes the consumer surplus is negative. and according to your example, the producer surplus will be zero. You are right it does not make sense whatsoever to reflect it as producer surplus."

How the ""insurance model"" of Rotschild and Stiglitz is a special case of this is presented on pg. 335, and then Theorem 3 on pg. 343 is what you need. The proof is not trivial, but - in my opinion - well presented. "
4367,Effect of Promotional Sales on a Demand Curve,Your textbook is correct. I believe you are confusing an increase in demand and a shift in the demand curve and conflating the quantity demanded with the demand curve.
4368,I don't understand the MV = PY,"Money demand is fixed because it depends on the real economy....that's an assumption. 
So when M changes only P can change. That's the theory. It's not really a theory. Just an accounting equality, since V is never defined exogenously. It's bad economics. :/"
4369,Non-negative deviations from Nash Equilibrium,"It depends on whether the other players' strategies in the initial equilibrium are still best responses to the deviator's new strategy. For example, $(T,L)$ is the unique NE in the game below. Player 1 (the row player) can deviate from $T$ to $B$ without hurting his own payoff, but $(B,L)$ is not a NE, since $L$ is not a best response to $B$ in this game. "

4377,"If a utility function is quasi-concave, can we say that the IC curve associated with it is convex?",In your example the IC curve is not convex in the usual meaning of the word convex when applied to sets. What you probably mean is that the IC curve implicitly defines a convex function $f$ where $f(x) = y$.
4378,What are 'Symmetric Agents' vs. 'Asymmetric Agents'?,"“Symmetric agents” generally means that all the agents have the same payoff function and the same information set. In this case, it’s the function you’ve specified. It’s often the case that, because symmetric agents will all respond the same way, they can be replaced with a single representative agent, in contrast to heterogenous agent models. "
4379,Example of a rational and continuous preference relation that does not admit a utility representation,"A necessary condition for a preference relation to be represented by a utility function is that the preference relation is rational (where a ""utility function"" is a real-valued function that assigns a higher or equal numerical value to bundle A than to bundle B, when A is weakly preferred to B)."

4388,How is marginal benefit measured?,"The reason why marginal benefit is measured in cans of soda is that this economy only has two goods: pizza and soda. So instead of using money we may as well use soda. Alternatively, in the absence of money this economy is an exchange economy, and the only way to pay for pizza in that case is with soda."

4405,What lies behind supply and demand model?,The “law of supply and demand” is a feature of economic models with supply and demand curves. These are usually mainstream equilibrium models. It is somewhat difficult to relate these models to real world behaviour. I am in a theoretical camp that is critical of such models; perhaps someone else can give a better account.

4411,Multi-product profit maximization,"At the end of the day, the firm seeks to maximize profits, which is a one-dimensional object. So the firm simply solves 
\begin{equation}

where $\mathbf x\in\mathbb R_+^\ell$ is a vector of $\ell$ inputs, $\mathbf p\in\mathbb R_+^n$ is a vector of $n$ prices for the final output, $\mathbf f:\mathbb R_+^\ell\to\mathbb R_+^n$ is the production function mapping $\ell$ inputs to $n$ outputs, and $c:\mathbb R_+^\ell\to \mathbb R_+$ is the cost function. This is a standard unconstrained optimization exercise that any first year grad student in economics should know how to solve. The standard textbooks --- MWG, Jehle and Reny, Simon and Blume --- have sections that cover the techniques."
4412,"Calculating the real interest rate, why would my thesis supervisor want me to subtract inflation instead of dividing by inflation?","Two things to note here. First, subtracting inflation from the nominal interest rate is an approximation to the real interest rate, but only in discrete time. Furthermore, the ""true"" relationship it's approximating isn't division of one rate by the other--you have to add 1 to all three of your quantities (inflation, real interest rate, and nominal interest rate) first to get the true relationship."

During a crisis, there is an unwillingness to lend  against collateral at any price (interest rate). Financial firms are liquidity constrained, and they assume that the entities that want to borrow are similarly constrained. Being able to fund positions in securities at any price is a huge relief, since that means you are not forced to sell (at a distressed price)."
4417,Asset pricing vs Empirical asset pricing,"As mentioned in Herr K's comment, asset pricing is the theory to price assets (such as equity, bonds, options, futures, swaps, etc). For this, you can use models like CAPM/Fama-French (returns), Black-Scholes (options), Swensonn (interest rates), and many many others. When you say empirical asset pricing, this means that you go to the data (and each model deals with a different type of data) and try to price an existing asset based on the information that you see on the market.

\end{align*}
This will then results in log utility. Calculating the limit goes as follows.
Since plugging in $\sigma = 0$ would give $\frac 0 0$, we use L'Hopital's rule.
This gives us
\begin{align*}
\lim_{\sigma \rightarrow 1} \frac{C^{1-\sigma}}{1-\sigma}
  &= \lim_{\sigma \rightarrow 1} \frac{- C^{1-\sigma} \log C}{-1} \\
  &= \log C.

4429,Basic Reason of Why the Money Supply Needs to Increase? [duplicate],"I would highlight this article on money creation in the modern economy (by researchers at the Bank of England) - (link to article). A key observation is that modern central banks do not directly determine the money supply, they set the rate of interest. (The policy of Quantitative Easing complicates matters, but what is happening there is that the monetary base is larger tha usual, but the central bank cannot set it below an effective minimum.)"

4437,Can one prove Pareto efficiency in an n-party system by showing all Pareto improvements between any two given parties are made?,"@HerrK. got it right in his comment (he should have deleted the somewhat confusing ""yes"" from the beginning and then posted it as an answer) It is possible that no pairwise improvements are possible but general Pareto-improvements are still possible. A simple counterexample for three actors and three goods is as follows. Let the utility functions be the same for all actors, that is
$$
U_A(x,y,z) = U_B(x,y,z) = U_C(x,y,z) = \min(x,y,z).
$$
Let actor $A$ have 3 units of good $x$, and 0 units of the other goods, whereas actor $B$ has 3 units of good $y$, and 0 units of the other goods, and actor $C$ has 3 units of good $z$, and 0 units of the other goods. No pairwise exchange can increase utilities above zero. But the goods could be distributed so that everyone has a unit of each. This would increase all utilities to one, making the original distribution not Pareto-efficient."
